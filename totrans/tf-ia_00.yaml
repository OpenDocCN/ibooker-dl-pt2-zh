- en: These days it is hard to find a real-world system or a product that is not driven
    or at least impacted by machine learning. Machine learning plays a paramount role
    in terms of boosting user experience as well as cutting costs and increasing savings
    for a company. TensorFlow is a machine learning framework that enables developers
    to develop machine learning solutions quickly for various bespoke use cases that
    can benefit from machine learning. If you are a machine learning practitioner
    or even a software engineer who touches on machine learning systems, it pays to
    have a well-grounded understanding of TensorFlow, as it’s used by millions of
    developers to build ML solutions.

    learning tasks as well as state-of-the-art models. You will learn about image
    classification and segmentation, and various natural language processing tasks,
    such as language modeling and sentiment analysis. While doing so, we will try
    to maintain our code production quality. This means we will explore ways in which
    we can standardize our code and models, such as building robust end-to-end data
    pipelines that can wrangle common data types such as images and text. We will
    also pay attention to other important dimensions, such as model explainability,
    current state-of-the-art performance on similar tasks, and so forth. We conclude
    the book with how TensorFlow can be used to build production-level machine learning
    pipelines to deliver a smooth operational experience for developers.

- en: TensorFlow has good documentation coverage (although certain topics can be better
    documented) that is available for free. You might be wondering why, then, you
    need this book. TensorFlow has evolved to become a complex ecosystem with many
    moving parts. For someone initially learning the technology, it is quite easy
    to get lost in the documentation and waste hours (if not days). The rapid pace
    at which new features and new releases come out exacerbates this problem. Therefore,
    it helps to have a resource that collates all the most up-to-date and important
    information and best practices of TensorFlow into a digestible, well-explained
    text.

    familiar with building data pipelines that can perform complex transformations
    in just a few lines of code.
