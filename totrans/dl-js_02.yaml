- en: This book owes *Deep Learning with Python* by François Chollet for its overall
    structure. Despite the fact that the code was rewritten in a different language
    and much new content was added for the JavaScript ecosystem and to reflect new
    developments in the field, neither this book nor the entire high-level API of
    TensorFlow.js would have been a reality without pioneer work on Keras led by François.

- en: Our journey to the completion of this book and all the related code was made
    pleasant and fulfilling thanks to the incredible support from our colleagues on
    Google’s TensorFlow.js Team. The seminal and foundational work by Daniel Smilkov
    and Nikhil Thorat on the low-level WebGL kernels and backpropagation forms a rock-solid
    foundation for model building and training. The work by Nick Kreeger on the Node.js
    binding to TensorFlow’s C library is the main reason why we can run neural networks
    in the browser and Node.js with the same code. The TensorFlow.js data API by David
    Soergel and Kangyi Zhang makes [chapter 6](kindle_split_018.html#ch06) of the
    book possible, while [chapter 7](kindle_split_019.html#ch07) was enabled by the
    visualization work by Yannick Assogba. The performance optimization techniques
    described in [chapter 11](kindle_split_023.html#ch11) wouldn’t be possible without
    Ping Yu’s work on op-level interface with TensorFlow. The speed of our examples
    wouldn’t be nearly as fast as it is today without the focused performance optimization
    work by Ann Yuan. The leadership of Sarah Sirajuddin, Sandeep Gupta, and Brijesh
    Krishnaswami is critical to the overall long-term success of the TensorFlow.js
    project.

    D. Sculley, who carefully reviewed all the chapters of the book. We’re also immensely
    grateful for all the encouragement we received from Fernanda Viegas, Martin Wattenberg,
    Hal Abelson, and many other colleagues of ours at Google. Our writing and content
    were greatly improved as a result of the detailed review by François Chollet,
    Nikhil Thorat, Daniel Smilkov, Jamie Smith, Brian K. Lee, and Augustus Odena,
    as well as by in-depth discussion with Suharsh Sivakumar.

- en: One of the unique pleasures of working on a project such as TensorFlow.js is
    the opportunity to work alongside and interact with the worldwide open-source
    software community. TensorFlow.js was fortunate to have a group of talented and
    driven contributors including Manraj Singh, Kai Sasaki, Josh Gartman, Sasha Illarionov,
    David Sanders, syt123450@, and many many others, whose tireless work on the library
    expanded its capability and improved its quality. Manraj Singh also contributed
    the phishing-detection example used in [chapter 3](kindle_split_014.html#ch03)
    of the book.

    and tireless work by Brian Sawyer, Jennifer Stout, Rebecca Rinehart, and Mehmed
    Pasic, and many others made it possible for we authors to focus on writing the
    content. Marc-Philip Huget provided extensive and incisive technical review throughout
    the development process. Special thanks go to our reviewers, Alain Lompo, Andreas
    Refsgaard, Buu Nguyen, David DiMaria, Edin Kapic, Edwin Kwok, Eoghan O’Donnell,
    Evan Wallace, George thomas, Giuliano Bertoti, Jason Hales, Marcio Nicolau, Michael
    Wall, Paulo Nuin, Pietro Maffi, Polina Keselman, Prabhuti Prakash, Ryan Burrows,
    Satej Sahu, Suresh Rangarajulu, Ursin Stauss, and Vaijanath Rao, whose suggestions
    helped make this a better book.

    and sacrifice on the part of our families. Shanqing Cai would like to express
    the deepest gratitude to his wife, Wei, as well as his parents and parents-in-law
    for their help and support during this book’s year-long writing process. Stan
    Bileschi would like to thank his mother and father, as well as his step-mother
    and step-father, for providing a foundation and direction to build a successful
    career in science and engineering. He would also like to thank his wife, Constance,
    for her love and support. Eric Nielsen would like to say to his friends and family,
    thank you.
