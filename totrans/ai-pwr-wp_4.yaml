    both in the details like choosing a good typeface, and also in the quality and
    style of your writing overall. When spellcheckers arrived, we no longer had to
    be great at spelling. With AI, we no longer have to be great at writing itself!

    You select the font size, font family (such as Times Roman), font style (normal
    or italic) weight (how thick the characters’ lines are, **boldface** vs. regular,
    for example), and other qualities like letter spacing and line height. The theme
    you choose provides some defaults, but you should fine-tune it.

    sites have an easygoing, conversational style. So if you come from a legal, academic,
    or otherwise formal-writing background, you’ll learn in this chapter how to relax
    your writing—how to master a different, more conversational, approach. And AI
    can help you rewrite your text in a way that will be more casual and more appealing
    to the average person.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most people don’t really understand typography, or even think about it. But
    on some level it has an effect on them. Choose an attractive and readable typeface
    and font size for your site’s body text, headlines, and captions. And the single
    most important consideration here is *readability*. You want to display characters
    that are large enough to be legible. Font size on screens is usually specified
    in *pixels*.

- en: The *pixel* or *px* (picture element) refers to the smallest visual unit, the
    individual dots on a digital display. But a pixel isn’t a fixed size, like an
    inch. It’s relative. Pixel size is relative to the size of the screen as a whole.
    So a Jumbotron screen in a football stadium would have brick-size pixels, but
    a tablet’s pixels would likely be too small to be visible to the eye. A pixel
    is that single point of color you can usually see by getting up close to a big
    screen TV.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    large language model like GPT should not only learn from text input, but also
    from other modalities like video, graphics, music, even traffic cameras, or any
    other source of information. In other words, learn from real-world input the way
    people do. (Only much faster than we learn, and forgetting nothing, ever.)

    from the Internet, and they combine that with text (for example, labeling the
    images by storing captions). But the goal is for AI systems to learn from all
    varieties of information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A related area of continuing research involves allowing us users to submit multi-modal
    prompts to AI systems. In a limited way, current text-to-image systems do permit
    this. You can upload images to GPT, Google’s Bard, and Midjourney, in addition
    to text prompts. Then AI generates its output based on both the images and the
    text. The degree to which the output resembles the submitted images can be adjusted
    on a sliding scale in some systems.

    for sites like hospitals and banks, where reliability and trustworthiness must
    be conveyed. However, most sites should choose a sans-serif typeface (plain, no

    Arial, Verdana, and Helvetica.

    vice versa—light against light. Obviously, this lack of contrast negatively impacts
    readability and is particularly frustrating for people with poor eyesight. Text
    should contrast against its background. This generally means text that’s black
    or dark against a background that’s white or light. The best choice is usually
    just plain old reliable black and white. And the background shouldn’t compete
    with the text—so no wallpaper or vivid images under the text. In matters like
    backgrounds, subtlety is to be preferred.
