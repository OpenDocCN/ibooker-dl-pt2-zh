    The good news is that we’re not trying to qualify as physicists and engineers,

    developing algorithms and models capable of automatically learning and improving
    from data without explicit programming. It involves training a system on a large
    dataset to recognize patterns, make predictions, or perform tasks. By iteratively

    computational system that learns patterns, structures, or relationships from data.
    It’s a trained algorithm or network that can take input and generate meaningful
    output based on its learned knowledge or trained parameters. In generative AI,
    a model refers specifically to a system that can generate new data samples that
    resemble the training data, whether it’s generating images, text, music, or other
    forms of creative content. The model encapsulates the learned information and
    the ability to generate new instances based on that knowledge.

- en: '**Labels** are categorizations or annotations assigned to data points. They
    provide explicit information about the characteristics or attributes associated
    with the input. Labels act as guiding signals to help the model learn and generate
    output that aligns with the desired attributes or properties. One place where
    labels are commonly used is for sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis involves
    training a model to classify text as either positive, negative, or neutral based
    on its emotional tone. To perform this task, we need to label our training data
    with appropriate sentiments (e.g., "this review is positive," "this tweet is negative").'

    neurons or features in a model. These weights determine the strength or importance
    of each connection and play a crucial role in the model’s learning and decision-making
    process. During training, the weights are adjusted iteratively based on the observed
    errors or differences between predicted and actual outputs, enabling the model
    to learn from the data and improve its performance by assigning appropriate weights
    to different inputs and connections. Weighting is commonly used for named entity
    recognition (NER), which involves identifying and categorizing entities mentioned
    in text into predefined categories like person, organization, and location. A
    weighted NER model, for instance, be used for a chatbot application to extract
    and respond to user queries about specific topics or entities.'

    of a given input, typically in the form of a sequence of symbols or text, and
    generates a structured representation based on a predefined grammar or set of
    rules. It is commonly used in natural language processing to parse sentences and
    extract syntactic or semantic information. Parsers break down the input into constituent

    function to the training data. The goal is to find the best-fitting function that
    minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. Regression
    algorithms analyze the patterns and trends in the data to make predictions or
    infer relationships. Regression can be another tool for sentiment analysis. For

    to reach the optimal set of values that minimize the objective function. In the
    world of optimizing models, there are some popular techniques like "stochastic
    gradient descent" and its variations. These methods help the model get better
    by adjusting its internal settings according to how much it’s improving or getting

    performance on downstream tasks with limited data. One practical application of
    all this would be medical imaging, where vector embeddings can be used to analyze
    and compare images of organs or tissues. A deep learning model can be trained
    to map brain scans onto a vector space, where similar scans are clustered together.

    specifically when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Let’s say we have a dataset
    of movie reviews, where the majority class is positive reviews (e.g., "good movie")
    and the minority class is negative reviews (e.g., "bad movie"). Without regularization,
    the model might become biased towards the positive reviews and fail to accurately
    classify the negative reviews. To address this imbalance, we can add a regularization
    term to the loss function that penalizes the model for misclassifying negative
    reviews.
