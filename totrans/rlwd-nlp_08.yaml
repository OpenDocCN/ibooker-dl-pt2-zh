- en: The field of NLP has seen rapid progress in the past few years. Specifically,
    the advent of the Transformer and pretrained language models such as BERT have
    completely changed the landscape of the field and how practitioners build NLP
    applications. This part of the book will help you catch up with these latest developments.

- en: Chapter 6 introduces sequence-to-sequence models, an important class of models
    that will enable you to build more complex applications such as machine translation
    systems and chatbots. Chapter 7 discusses another type of popular neural network
    architecture, *convolutional neural networks* (CNNs).

- en: Chapters 8 and 9 are arguably the most important and exciting chapters of this
    book. They cover the Transformer and transfer learning methods (such as BERT)
    respectively. We’ll demonstrate how to build advanced NLP applications such as
    high-quality machine translation and spell-checkers, using those technologies.
