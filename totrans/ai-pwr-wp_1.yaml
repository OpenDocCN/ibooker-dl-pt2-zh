    that practice site, and install the Twenty Sixteen theme. Also, this book focuses
    on the classic WordPress editor, rather than the Gutenberg block editor. So you

    you have to find a developer that you hope is competent. Many developers are more
    skilled at programming than design, so you can easily end up with a smoothly functioning
    site that looks, to put it kindly, pretty ugly. Too much media, or too little.

    tack things on. The result can be a patchwork, a disjointed collection of features
    and designs that don’t really work together to result in a clear overall purpose
    and context. Transitions between the pages can seem jarring. Site navigation can

    topic that generic can easily sink your online efforts into oblivion. The reason

    problems down the road. Freemium themes provide an income to their creators and
    thus are rarely abandoned. So you won’t be forced to switch to a new theme down
    the road. That can be problematic, especially if your site grows large.'

    what you’re marketing. If you’re offering a site about gardening, how can you
    use color to best advantage? In other words, after you’ve chosen a theme, customize

    site look unique, and in service of the site’s goal?

    to do something one way, then a few weeks later try to repeat it and find that
    the process has changed. It can also be inefficient and difficult to learn and
    work with, especially if you’re used to the traditional WordPress editor.

    pages should be rendered. *Vertical* layout is easy. Drag and drop (used by Gutenberg)

    trick to accomplish via drag and drop. And it’s a trick that Gutenberg hasn’t
    yet mastered. HTML has complex, multiple, interacting positioning variables that
    describe horizontal layout. You have borders, alignment, divisions, margins, relative,
    static, containers, padding, and other specs all interacting to specify an object’s
    location on the X axis. Horizontal positioning on an internet page is not a straightforward
    process at all.'
