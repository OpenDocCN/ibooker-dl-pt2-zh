    notion of “thinking machines” has been a theme in scientific literature and popular
    culture for decades. Now, AI is poised to be a transformative economic force that
    will amplify productivity and give birth to entirely new industries and markets.
    Recently, generative AI tools like ChatGPT have attracted exceptional attention
    and substantial investments.

    to temper this enthusiasm with a dose of reality. Many AI applications are still
    in their infancy, and the road to achieving true artificial general intelligence
    remains long and uncertain. Separating genuine advancements from exaggerated claims
    is essential to harness the true potential of AI while navigating the challenges
    it presents. In this book, we’ll look at the current state of AI and consider
    where AI may be going next.

    Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity” is often cited as the starting point in practical
    AI research. Their paper introduces a mathematical procedure for inferring relationships
    between propositions, and they suggested that neurons and their connections could
    be modeled in terms of true-or-false logical statements. Their technique led to
    the design of circuits that can compute Boolean functions, which are the fundamental
    operations of all digital computers.

    which has become one of the most referenced papers in the field. Turing proposes
    that a machine could be considered intelligent if it passed the so-called Turing
    test. If the observer cannot discern a human’s answers from a computer’s answers,
    the computer would pass the test and be considered capable of thinking like a
    person.

    at Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956\. John McCarthy, then an assistant
    professor of mathematics at Dartmouth, used the term for its marketing effect.
    He expected the catchy phrase to boost the visibility of this new research field.
    It would seem that he succeeded since he later became the first director of the
    AI labs at MIT.

    and disenchantment. One might question whether inflated expectations and the subsequent
    disillusionment are, in part, attributable to the field’s name. So, what precisely
    is the definition of AI? At its core, AI involves a set of technologies that enable
    computers to perform tasks traditionally associated with human intelligence. Since
    its inception, AI has relied heavily on two fundamental methods for algorithms
    to learn from data. In supervised learning, imagine yourself wanting to teach
    an AI system about fruits by providing labeled examples like “This is an apple;
    that’s a banana,” allowing the system to learn how to identify new fruits based
    on prior examples. On the other hand, unsupervised learning takes a more exploratory
    approach, operating without labels or guides. The AI system independently analyzes
    the data, grouping similar items together, such as placing all red apples in one
    category without being explicitly told they are apples.

    intelligently, whether they actually employ the same mechanisms required for human
    intelligence. Weizenbaum sees AI in machines capable of mundane tasks like assembling
    nuts and bolts with the aid of synthetic vision and robotic arms as well as in
    computer programs that could aid in synthesizing chemical compounds, translating
    languages, composing music, and even writing software—all tasks possible now with
    current generative AI tools.

    all the decisions we make. The challenge of AI is simply knowing to what extent
    a computer program can simulate certain intelligence reflexes and how a computer
    program behaves when faced with a problem for which we often ignore our own mental
    operations to resolve. However, no matter how we define AI, we are increasingly
    able to see its effects in everyday life, shaping the way we work, communicate,
    and navigate the world around us.

    gender bias in facial recognition systems have been well-documented, raising serious
    ethical questions about how biased technology might perpetuate societal inequalities.
    Similar biases have been observed in AI used in automated hiring systems, inadvertently
    favoring certain characteristics and contributing to disparities that further
    marginalize underrepresented groups. Furthermore, incorporating AI into the criminal
    justice system raises concerns about potential biases, fairness, and the transparency
    of the sentencing process. AI algorithms that analyze various factors to predict
    recidivism or assess the likelihood of reoffending may inadvertently sustain existing
    biases in the system, presenting challenges in ensuring a fair and just legal

    machine learning to provide technology for human–machine interaction. This approach
    was introduced in 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum with his program ELIZA, which was
    created to provide person-centered therapy. ELIZA is the ancestor of ChatGPT,
    Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, which are now omnipresent in smartphones and
    home devices.

    Once ELIZA identified one of these words, it responded by changing the sentence
    in accordance with a rule associated with that word. ELIZA would then give a content-free
    response or reference the previous topic for input text such as “Why do you think
    that?” which contained no keywords. In his paper, Weizenbaum gave a slightly contrived
    example of a conversation between ELIZA and a female test subject:'

    what it was saying. A few psychotherapists even thought it might be a helpful
    tool for their practice. In reality, all the program could do was decompose the
    user’s input into its constituent parts of speech and repeat them back in a manner
    that sustained the conversation. Weizenbaum was so disturbed that users could
    put their faith in a relatively simple program that he became an advocate for
    social responsibility. He became a vocal critic of any AI that gave the illusion
    of intelligence.
