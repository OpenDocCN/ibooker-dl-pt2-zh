- en: This book was written for anyone who wishes to explore deep learning from scratch
    or broaden their understanding of deep learning. Whether you’re a practicing machine
    learning engineer, a data scientist, or a college student, you’ll find value in
    these pages.

- en: You’ll explore deep learning in an approachable way—starting simply, then working
    up to state-of-the-art techniques. You’ll find that this book strikes a balance
    between intuition, theory, and hands-on practice. It avoids mathematical notation,
    preferring instead to explain the core ideas of machine learning and deep learning
    via detailed code snippets and intuitive mental models. You’ll learn from abundant
    code examples that include extensive commentary, practical recommendations, and
    simple high-level explanations of everything you need to know to start using deep
    learning to solve concrete problems.

    its numerical engine. They demonstrate modern Keras and TensorFlow 2 best practices
    as of 2022.

    is, when it’s applicable, and what its limitations are. You’ll be familiar with
    the standard workflow for approaching and solving machine learning problems, and
    you’ll know how to address commonly encountered issues. You’ll be able to use
    Keras to tackle real-world problems ranging from computer vision to natural language
    processing: image classification, image segmentation, time-series forecasting,
    text classification, machine translation, text generation, and more.'

    don’t need previous experience with machine learning or deep learning: this book
    covers, from scratch, all the necessary basics. You don’t need an advanced mathematics
    background, either—high school–level mathematics should suffice to follow along.'

    in line with normal text. In both cases, source code is formatted in a fixed-width
    font like this to separate it from ordinary text. Output from running code is
    similarly formatted in fixed-width font, but is also adorned with a vertical gray

    breaks and reworked indentation to accommodate the available page space in the
    book. In rare cases, even this was not enough, and listings include line-continuation
    markers (![Image](../images/common01.jpg)). Additionally, comments in the source
    code have often been removed from the listings when the code is described in the
    text. Code annotations accompany many of the listings, highlighting important
    concepts.

    or station in life was just by their dress. Manning celebrates the inventiveness
    and initiative of the computer business with book covers based on the rich diversity
    of regional culture centuries ago, brought back to life by pictures from collections
    such as this one.
