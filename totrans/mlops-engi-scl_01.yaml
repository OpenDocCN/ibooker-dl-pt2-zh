- en: Engineering an effective machine learning system depends on a thorough understanding
    of the project data set. If you have prior experience building machine learning
    models, you might be tempted to skip this step. After all, shouldn’t the machine
    learning algorithms automate the learning of the patterns from the data? However,
    as you are going to observe throughout this book, machine learning systems that
    succeed in production depend on a practitioner who understands the project data
    set and then applies human insights about the data in ways that modern algorithms
    can’t.
