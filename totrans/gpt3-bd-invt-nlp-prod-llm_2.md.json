Develop a routine \n\nWork can be overwhelming. You don't need to remember every little detail. \nBy having a routine, you will be able to work more efficiently. \n\n2\\. Avoid multitasking \n\nIf you are multitasking, you are bound to miss something. It is better to\nwork on one task at a time. \n\n3\\. Take breaks \n\nIt is true that if you do not take breaks, you will be more productive. However, \nif you take breaks too often you will get tired and stressed. If you work more \neffectively, you will shorten the time needed to complete a task. \n\n4\\. Learn to delegate \n\nIf you have a lot of work to do, you should not do everything on your own. \nDelegate some of the work to others.\n\n5\\. Prioritize \n\nPrioritize what you have to do and do the most important tasks first.
