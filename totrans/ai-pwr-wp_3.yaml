    There’s zero chance that your site will show up if someone searches for *fishing.*

    a celebrity, with an existing fan base eager for the details about your comings

    menu, there are alternatives. Your goal is always to find the best, quickest way
    for your visitors to find the information they’re looking for. Every site should
    have a search tool on every page. Although most people would rather click a link
    or a menu item than type in a search term, you do need to provide a good way for
    visitors to locate highly specific information. And a search tool serves that
    purpose. Most themes include a basic search feature, but you might want to use
    a specialized search plugin that would offer additional options like drilling
    down, auto-completion, and perhaps thumbnail previews.

    and comprehensive list of links to every topic and subtopic in the entire site.
    It’s also said that sitemaps can also improve your rank with Google and AI bots.

    links. Ensure that all your links actually go to real targets rather than triggering
    “Page not found” error messages. To test links in a small site, you can just check
    them manually by clicking them on the front end.Larger sites can use the Google
    Search Console plugin. Or use this online checker: [https://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/broken-links.php](www.brokenlinkcheck.com.html)

    to fill them with content. We’ll start with text content. Most writing for the
    web requires a special tone and style. And as you’ll see in the next chapter,
    AI is great at turning your first draft into outstanding, web-ready prose.

    and child pages. This results in a simpler menu that displays only the main (parent)
    categories, and hides the secondary (child) pages--they only become visible when
    a visitor hovers their mouse pointer on the parent.

    and having to scan headlines to locate what interests you is considerably clumsier
    than reading a menu.

    only a few items on the menu, and keep the length of each menu item brief.
