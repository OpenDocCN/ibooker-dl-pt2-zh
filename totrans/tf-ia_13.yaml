- en: Deep learning has come a long way since the introduction of models like convolutional
    neural networks, LSTMs, and so on. Transformer-based models encompassing billions
    of parameters have out-performed the aforementioned models across the board. Another
    topic that has gained popularity, due to the demand for better models and agility
    in developing ML models, is tracking and productionizing ML models.

- en: In part 3, we will first discuss a more complex variant of RNN based models
    known as sequence-to-sequence models. Then we will discuss Transformer-based models
    in more detail and see firsthand how they can be used for tasks like spam classification
    and question answering. You will also learn how you can leverage high-level libraries
    like Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers to implement solutions quickly.

    models. You will learn about easily visualizing model performance over time and
    advanced capabilities like performance profiling. Finally, we introduce TFX, a
    library that standardizes the productionization of ML models. You will develop
    an end-to-end pipeline that manages the ML workflow end to end, from data to the
    deployment.
