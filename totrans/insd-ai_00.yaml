  zh: 前言
- en: In 1999, I was in the last year of my five-year mandate as Secretary-General
    of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL). An American friend
    who thought we might have mutual interests introduced me to Akli. We met for lunch
    in Paris, and after the usual introductory niceties, we began to discuss the possible
    connections between what Akli was doing professionally and the essence of my own
    role at the Interpol headquarters in Lyon, France. In my previous function at
    Scotland Yard in London, I had worked for some period in the Criminal Intelligence
    Division and was naturally interested in any developments where the exploitation
    of intelligence analysis could be applied to Interpol databases.

  zh: 1999年，我在国际刑警组织（国际刑警组织）担任五年任期的秘书长的最后一年。一位认为我们可能有共同兴趣的美国朋友向我介绍了阿克利。我们在巴黎共进午餐，经过常规的问候后，我们开始讨论阿克利在职业上所做的事情与我在法国里昂的国际刑警总部的角色的可能联系。在伦敦苏格兰场的之前的职能中，我在刑事情报部门工作过一段时间，自然对情报分析的应用到国际刑警组织数据库的任何发展都很感兴趣。
- en: I should perhaps, at this stage, indicate why my first meeting with Akli was
    an “experience.” During my functions at Interpol, I have met many important and
    impressive people, including two presidents of the United States, but Akli impressed
    me in a different way. His physical presence, no doubt because of his Kabyle origins,
    of which he is particularly proud, gives the impression of someone who is sure
    of himself, can be relied upon to tell you the truth, and will give authoritative
    opinions. Akli’s impression immediately strikes you and sets the climate in which
    discussions will take place. Unfortunately, circumstances did not make it possible
    for me to develop a project for Interpol at the time, so my continued interest
    in Akli’s activities became more personal than professional. However, by this
    time, he was establishing himself in the United States.

  zh: 也许在这个阶段，我应该说明一下，为什么我与阿克利的第一次会面是一种“体验”。在国际刑警组织的职能范围内，我曾经见过许多重要和令人印象深刻的人，包括两位美国总统，但阿克利以一种不同的方式给我留下了深刻印象。他的外形，毫无疑问是因为他的卡比尔起源，他为此特别自豪，给人一种他对自己有把握，可以信赖他说出真相，并将给出权威意见的印象。阿克利的印象立即给你留下深刻印象，并创造了讨论的气氛。遗憾的是，当时的环境并没有让我为国际刑警组织开展一个项目的可能性，因此，我对阿克利的活动的持续兴趣变得更加个人而非专业。然而，此时此刻，他正在美国建立自己。
- en: Akli earned a master’s degree at the University of Technology of Compiègne and
    a doctorate in Artificial Intelligence at Pierre and Marie Curie University. For
    his thesis, Akli developed software at Necker Hospital in Paris to enable doctors
    to diagnose emergency patients rapidly. Artificial intelligence was known at the
    time but was in its infancy. The work that Akli accomplished in his five-year
    thesis was recognized by the press. This proved to Akli that he could build a
    viable future career using his special brand of AI technology.

  zh: 阿克利在科皮耶让技术大学获得硕士学位，并在皮埃尔和玛丽·居里大学获得了人工智能博士学位。在他的论文中，阿克利在巴黎的内克尔医院开发了软件，以便医生快速诊断急诊病人。人工智能当时是众所周知的，但处于萌芽阶段。阿克利在他五年的论文中所做的工作受到了新闻的认可。这向阿克利证明，他可以利用自己的特殊AI技术品牌建立一个可行的未来职业。
- en: By the time of his departure to the United States, Akli had already founded
    his own software company and worked with a number of well-known French companies
    and governmental organizations. During this time, he also taught at EPITA, a school
    of engineering, where he led the Department of Cognitive Science. For his last
    year in France, Akli had achieved certain notoriety but had already decided that
    the best chance for the effective development of his professional talents lay
    in the United States. In 1999, he took the steps that would eventually lead to
    his present successes in AI.

  zh: 在他前往美国时，阿克利已经创立了自己的软件公司，并与许多知名的法国公司和政府机构合作。在这期间，他还在工程学院EPITA教书，领导了认知科学系。在法国的最后一年，阿克利已经获得了某些名声，但已经决定，他的专业才能的有效发展最好的机会在美国。1999年，他采取了措施，最终导致了他在人工智能方面的现在的成功。
- en: Beginning his new enterprise in San Francisco was not easy, and to a certain
    extent, I shared a part of the trials and tribulations with him. He was living
    alone without his wife and family, who were still in France. He still had a teaching
    obligation in Paris with EPITA, but he was trying at the same time to establish
    his own company, which he called Brighterion. Resources were limited, and anyone
    other than Akli would have thrown in the towel. It was in such difficult circumstances
    that Akli’s strength of character came to the fore.

  zh: 刚开始在旧金山开展新事业并不容易，某种程度上，我和他一起分享了部分艰辛与磨难。他独自生活，没有妻子和家人陪伴，他们还在法国。他还在巴黎的EPITA承担着教学任务，但同时也在努力建立自己的公司，他称之为Brighterion。资源有限，除了Akli之外，任何人都可能会放弃。正是在这种困难的环境下，Akli的性格优势显现出来。
- en: 'Akli will say that he owes persistence to his Kabyle origins. Akli is a man
    of principle who lives by the application of certain basic rules in his day-to-day
    activities, both in public and in private. Some would refer to these values as
    old-fashioned, including me, because we feel that they are lacking in our modern
    society: the notions of friendship, loyalty, and honesty seem to be lacking, particularly
    in the world of affairs. I am convinced that Akli owes his success to the fact
    that he has always applied these rules to his relations with other people. There
    is no doubt that Brighterion owes its present status and its future development—albeit
    now sold to Mastercard—to Akli and a key group of people who have been loyal to
    him, particularly when times have been difficult.'

  zh: Akli会说他的坚持来自他的卡比尔起源。Akli是一个秉持一定基本规则生活的原则派人物，无论在公共场合还是私下活动中都是如此。一些人会将这些价值观称为老派，我也是，因为我们感觉到这些价值在我们现代社会中缺失：友谊、忠诚和诚实的概念似乎缺乏，特别是在商业世界中。我确信Akli之所以成功，是因为他始终将这些规则应用于与他人的关系中。毫无疑问，Brighterion的现在和未来发展——尽管现在已经卖给了万事达卡——归功于Akli和一批在困难时期仍然忠诚于他的关键人员。
- en: I have often asked Akli for explanations of what I see in the media, which never
    corresponds to my understanding of what artificial intelligence means. I am sure
    that there are many others in my situation. Therefore, I am particularly grateful
    to Akli for having written such a book.

  zh: 我经常向Akli请教我在媒体上看到的东西，这与我对人工智能的理解从未相符。我相信还有许多其他人处于我的情况。因此，我特别感谢Akli写了这样一本书。
