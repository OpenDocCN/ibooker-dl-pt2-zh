- en: In 1999, I was in the last year of my five-year mandate as Secretary-General
    of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL). An American friend
    who thought we might have mutual interests introduced me to Akli. We met for lunch
    in Paris, and after the usual introductory niceties, we began to discuss the possible
    connections between what Akli was doing professionally and the essence of my own
    role at the Interpol headquarters in Lyon, France. In my previous function at
    Scotland Yard in London, I had worked for some period in the Criminal Intelligence
    Division and was naturally interested in any developments where the exploitation
    of intelligence analysis could be applied to Interpol databases.

- en: I should perhaps, at this stage, indicate why my first meeting with Akli was
    an “experience.” During my functions at Interpol, I have met many important and
    impressive people, including two presidents of the United States, but Akli impressed
    me in a different way. His physical presence, no doubt because of his Kabyle origins,
    of which he is particularly proud, gives the impression of someone who is sure
    of himself, can be relied upon to tell you the truth, and will give authoritative
    opinions. Akli’s impression immediately strikes you and sets the climate in which
    discussions will take place. Unfortunately, circumstances did not make it possible
    for me to develop a project for Interpol at the time, so my continued interest
    in Akli’s activities became more personal than professional. However, by this
    time, he was establishing himself in the United States.

    a doctorate in Artificial Intelligence at Pierre and Marie Curie University. For
    his thesis, Akli developed software at Necker Hospital in Paris to enable doctors
    to diagnose emergency patients rapidly. Artificial intelligence was known at the
    time but was in its infancy. The work that Akli accomplished in his five-year
    thesis was recognized by the press. This proved to Akli that he could build a
    viable future career using his special brand of AI technology.

    his own software company and worked with a number of well-known French companies
    and governmental organizations. During this time, he also taught at EPITA, a school
    of engineering, where he led the Department of Cognitive Science. For his last
    year in France, Akli had achieved certain notoriety but had already decided that
    the best chance for the effective development of his professional talents lay
    in the United States. In 1999, he took the steps that would eventually lead to
    his present successes in AI.

    extent, I shared a part of the trials and tribulations with him. He was living
    alone without his wife and family, who were still in France. He still had a teaching
    obligation in Paris with EPITA, but he was trying at the same time to establish
    his own company, which he called Brighterion. Resources were limited, and anyone
    other than Akli would have thrown in the towel. It was in such difficult circumstances
    that Akli’s strength of character came to the fore.

- en: 'Akli will say that he owes persistence to his Kabyle origins. Akli is a man
    of principle who lives by the application of certain basic rules in his day-to-day
    activities, both in public and in private. Some would refer to these values as
    old-fashioned, including me, because we feel that they are lacking in our modern
    society: the notions of friendship, loyalty, and honesty seem to be lacking, particularly
    in the world of affairs. I am convinced that Akli owes his success to the fact
    that he has always applied these rules to his relations with other people. There
    is no doubt that Brighterion owes its present status and its future development—albeit
    now sold to Mastercard—to Akli and a key group of people who have been loyal to
    him, particularly when times have been difficult.'

- en: I have often asked Akli for explanations of what I see in the media, which never
    corresponds to my understanding of what artificial intelligence means. I am sure
    that there are many others in my situation. Therefore, I am particularly grateful
    to Akli for having written such a book.
