Since its premiere, Interstellar gained a cult following,[5] and now is regarded by many sci-fi experts as one of the best science-fiction films of all time.\n    Interstellar was nominated for five awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning Best Visual Effects, and received numerous other accolades\"\"\"\n    # Split into a list of sentences\n    texts = text.split('.')\n\n    # Clean up to remove empty spaces and new lines\n    texts = np.array([t.strip(' \\n') for t in texts])\n    ```", "```py\n    # Get the embeddings\n    response = co.embed(\n      texts=texts,\n    ).embeddings\n\n    embeds = np.array(response)\n    print(embeds.shape)\n    ```", "```py\n    # Create the search index, pass the size of embedding\n    search_index = AnnoyIndex(embeds.shape[1], 'angular')\n\n    # Add all the vectors to the search index\n    for index, embed in enumerate(embeds):\n        search_index.add_item(index, embed)\n\n    search_index.build(10) \n    search_index.save('test.ann')\n    ```", "```py\n    def search(query):\n\n      # 1\\.
