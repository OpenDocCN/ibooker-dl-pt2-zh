- en: 'After reading [parts 1](kindle_split_010.html#part01) and [2](kindle_split_012.html#part02),
    you should now be familiar with how basic deep learning is done in TensorFlow.js.
    [Part 3](#part03) is intended for users who want to develop a firmer grasp of
    the techniques and gain a broader understanding of deep learning. [Chapter 6](kindle_split_018.html#ch06)
    covers techniques for ingesting, transforming, and using data for machine learning.
    [Chapter 7](kindle_split_019.html#ch07) presents tools for visualizing data and
    models. [Chapter 8](kindle_split_020.html#ch08) is concerned with the important
    phenomena of underfitting and overfitting and how to deal with them effectively.
    Based on this discussion, we introduce the universal workflow of machine learning.
    [Chapters 9](kindle_split_021.html#ch09)â€“[11](kindle_split_023.html#ch11) are
    hands-on tours of three advanced areas: sequence-oriented models, generative models,
    and reinforcement learning, respectively. They will familiarize you with some
    of the most exciting frontiers of deep learning.'
