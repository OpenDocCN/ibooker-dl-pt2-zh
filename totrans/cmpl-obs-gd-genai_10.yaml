    improve investment decision-making by providing more accurate predictions and
    recommendations based on large datasets and sophisticated algorithms. Of course,
    AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on, and there are concerns about bias
    in the training data used to develop AI models. Additionally, there are regulatory
    challenges related to the use of AI in finance, including ensuring transparency
    and accountability in decision-making processes. In other words, it’s possible
    that the AI-powered investment aeroplane may never actually take off.

    or sell en masse, they can create sudden price movements, leading to increased
    market volatility. This was evident during the COVID-19 pandemic when retail traders
    fueled a surge in stock prices through online platforms like Robinhood. Large
    scale changes in retail investor sentiment can lead to a shift in *market* sentiment,
    causing asset prices to rise or fall regardless of underlying fundamentals. So
    for example, if retail investors become optimistic about a particular sector or
    company, they may drive up demand for those assets, even if there aren’t necessarily
    strong reasons to support the increase.

    further disrupt traditional investment patterns by offering low-cost, diversified
    portfolios accessible to a wider range of investors. This democratization of investing
    could lead to new market dynamics and potentially upset established power structures
    within the financial industry. Depending on your perspective, this could be either
    a good thing or a bad thing. (For what it’s worth, I personally lean towards "good".)
  prefs: []

    can now easily share ideas, form communities around specific investment themes,
    and pressure institutions to take notice. This emerging trend towards decentralized
    investing could give birth to novel market phenomena and challenge traditional
    forms of market analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As retail investment behavior volumes grow and exercise greater influence, regulators
    may need to adapt existing regulations or introduce new ones to address risks
    associated with this shift. For example, stricter requirements for reporting and
    disclosure from retail investors or greater oversight of online brokerages could
    follow.

    institutional investors. I happen to think that’s a good thing. My personal investment
    preference involves buying lots of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF index fund and then
    ignoring it for 50 years. But, on a larger scale, fluctuations in retail investment
    activity can reduce market liquidity, making it harder for other participants
    to enter or exit positions quickly enough without significantly affecting prices.
  prefs: []

- en: Retail investors tend to chase popular trends and pile into certain sectors
    or assets, creating bubbles along the way. These bubbles can eventually pop, leading
    to sharp reversals and losses for unsuspecting investors. History has shown us
    examples of such bubbles, such as the dotcom boom or the housing market crash.
    In fact, traditionally, retail investors lack proper knowledge about investing
    principles, resulting in poor decision-making and susceptibility to fraudsters
    preying upon naivety. However, adding properly designed AI to the mix should help
    close this education gap, leading to benefits for both investors and markets by
    promoting informed choices backed by solid understanding. After all, AI guides
    should excel at encouraging self-control and discipline.

    risk stemming from coordinated actions taken across many individuals simultaneously.
    Imagine millions of people all buying or shorting the same security; such collective
    action could trigger flash crashes or exacerbate market instability. Similarly,
    social media platforms allow retail investors to engage in discussions, debate
    strategies, and react swiftly to news events. While this can foster healthy market
    competition, it also creates opportunities for feeding frenzies – rapid price
    swings driven largely by emotional decision-making rather than careful analysis.
    These situations can lead to unjustifiable gains or losses for innocent parties
    caught off guard.
