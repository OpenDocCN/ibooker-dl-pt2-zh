    the generator and the discriminator. They work in tandem, with the generator trying
    to create realistic data, and the discriminator trying to distinguish between
    real and generated data. Through this adversarial process, GANs can produce highly
    realistic and diverse outputs. And, if they’ve been trained on all the great films
