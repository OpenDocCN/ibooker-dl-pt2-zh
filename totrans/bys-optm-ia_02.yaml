    with accurate predictions. As we saw in section 1.2.1 and see again and again
    in this part, GPs offer calibrated quantification of uncertainty, which is a key
    component in any decision-making task and a feature that many ML models lack.

    over functions as well as a generalization of a multivariate normal distribution
    in infinite dimensions. We explore how via Bayes’ theorem, a GP can be updated
    to reflect our belief about a function’s value in light of new data.

    us, the users, to incorporate prior information into the predictions via the global
    trend and the variability of the GP’s predictions. By combining different components
    of the GP, we gain the ability to mathematically model a wide range of functions.

    state-of-the-art Python GP library GPyTorch. As you go through this part’s materials,
    you will gain hands-on experience designing and training GP models using GPyTorch.
