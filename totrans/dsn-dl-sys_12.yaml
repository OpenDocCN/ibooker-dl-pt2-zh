    some situations, special requirements may warrant spending the extra effort to
    build a deep learning system from scratch. In other cases, given finite resources
    and time, it may make sense to use existing components, or even systems as a whole,
    and tailor them to your own needs.

    have been implemented by different cloud vendors and open source communities.
    These operations range from serverless deployment to custom service container
    deployment. You will gain a sense of which pieces of these operations you can
    use to design your own project by comparing them with our reference architecture

    This is largely similar to the compute backend that powers the training component

    control or sophistication or already has an identity provider implementation,
    you may need to spend more time building a custom solution. After reading chapters

    multiple models without deploying each of them to separate endpoints, SageMaker
    provides a multimodel endpoint that also comes with configurable model-caching

    of this writing, SageMaker supports multi-container endpoints and serial inference
    pipelines, which are similar to the serving architecture and DAG support described

    see cloud vendors make products that do just that. The SageMaker Model Registry
    provides functionalities that map to many key concepts of the metadata and artifacts
    store of a deep learning system. For example, metadata, such as training metrics
    of a model and model versions, can be tracked using Model Registry. It does not,
    however, provide a storage solution for artifacts in the same component. You can
    easily build an interface on top of Model Registry and other Amazon storage products
    to provide the artifact storage aspect of this component.
