- en: Before starting with PyTorch, I spent several years working with TensorFlow
    versions 1 and 2\. Since I switched to PyTorch, I became more productive as a
    machine learning practitioner, and I found my experience learning and using PyTorch
    delightful. I wanted to share this experience with the readers of this book. In
    the process, I aim to help you pick up the core elements of PyTorch, guide you
    though the levels of abstraction available in the framework, and prepare you to
    transition from using PyTorch in isolation to using machine learning models implemented
    in PyTorch and integrated into a broader machine learning pipeline.

    application programming interface (API) and helping you gain a level of fluency
    with using the API to flatten the learning curve of the later chapters.

    including support for automatic differentiation, alternative gradient descent
    algorithms, and supporting utilities.

    processing unit (GPU) features and how to take advantage of GPUs to accelerate
    your machine learning code.

    PyTorch training and cover in-depth the distinction between traditional, parameter
    server-based approaches and ring-based distributed training (e.g., Horovod).
