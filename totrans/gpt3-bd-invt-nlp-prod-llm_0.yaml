- en: GPT-3, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, is a transformer-based large
    language model developed by OpenAI. It consists of a staggering 175 billion parameters.
    Anyone can access this large language model via the OpenAI API, a simple-to-use
    “text-in, text-out” user interface, without any technical prerequisites. This
    is the first time in history that an AI model as big as GPT-3 has been remotely
    hosted and made available to the general public with a simple API call. This new
    mode of access is called *model-as-a-service*. Because of this unprecedented access,
    many people, including the authors of this book, see GPT-3 as a first step toward
    democratizing artificial intelligence (AI).

- en: With the introduction of GPT-3, it is easier than ever before to build AI applications.
    This book will show you how easy it is to get started with the OpenAI API. Also,
    we’ll introduce you to innovative ways to leverage this tool for your use case.
    We’ll look at successful start-ups built on top of GPT-3 and corporations leveraging
    it in their product landscape, and examine problems and potential future trends
    in its development.

    and basic definitions needed to move comfortably in these subjects. In [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#using_the_openai_api),
    we do a deep dive into the API, breaking it down into the most important elements,
    such as engines and endpoints, describing their purposes and the best practices
    for readers who wish to interact with them on a deeper level. [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#programming_with_gpt_three)
    provides a simple and fun recipe for your first GPT-3-powered application.'

    we interview founders of some of the most successful GPT-3-based products and
    apps about their struggles and their experiences interacting with the model on
    a commercial scale. [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#gpt_three_for_corporations) takes a
    look at how enterprises view GPT-3 and its adoption potential. We discuss the
    problematic implications of wider GPT-3 adoption, such as misuse and bias, and
    progress in addressing those issues, in [Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml#challengescomma_controversiescomma_and).
    Finally, in [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#democratizing_access_to_ai), we look to the
    future, walking you through the most exciting trends and possibilities arising
    as GPT-3 settles into the wider commercial ecosystem.
