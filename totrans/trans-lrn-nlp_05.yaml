- en: Chapters 4, 5, and 6 dive deeper into some important transfer learning NLP approaches
    based on shallow neural networks, that is, neural networks with relatively few
    layers. They also begin to explore deep transfer learning via representative techniques
    that employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for key functions, such as ELMo.
