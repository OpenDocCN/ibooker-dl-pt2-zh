Test for File Upload Functionality:\n\n    Test Case 1.1: Upload a Valid File\n        Input: Choose a file with a valid format (e.g., .jpg, .pdf).\n        Expected Outcome: The file is successfully uploaded, and a confirmation message is displayed.\n\n    Test Case 1.2: Attempt to Upload an Invalid File\n        Input: Choose a file with an invalid format (e.g., .exe, .html).\n        Expected Outcome: An error message is displayed, indicating that the file format is not supported.\n\n2\\. Test for File Size Limit:\n\n    Test Case 2.1: Upload a File Below the Size Limit\n        Input: Choose a file smaller than the maximum allowed size.\n        Expected Outcome: The file is successfully uploaded, and a confirmation message is displayed.\n\n    Test Case 2.2: Attempt to Upload a File Exceeding the Size Limit\n        Input: Choose a file larger than the maximum allowed size.\n        Expected Outcome: An error message is displayed, indicating that the file exceeds the maximum size limit.\n\n3\\. Test for File Overwrite Protection:\n\n    Test Case 3.1: Upload a File with the Same Name as an Existing File\n        Input: Upload a file with a name that matches an existing file in the system.\n        Expected Outcome: An error message is displayed, indicating that a file with the same name already exists.\n\n4\\. Security Tests:\n\n    Test Case 4.1: Attempt to Upload a Malicious File (e.g., virus)\n        Input: Upload a known malicious file.\n        Expected Outcome: The system should detect the malicious file and prevent its upload, displaying a security warning.\n\n5\\. UI and User Experience Tests:\n\n    Test Case 5.1: Check for a User-Friendly Interface\n        Input: Use the file upload feature and evaluate the user interface for clarity and ease of use.\n        Expected Outcome: The interface should be intuitive, with clear instructions and feedback for users.\n\n    Test Case 5.2: Check for Proper Error Messages\n        Input: Attempt various erroneous actions during the file upload process.\n        Expected Outcome: Error messages should be descriptive, helping users understand and resolve issues.\n\n6\\. Integration Tests:\n\n    Test Case 6.1: Check File Upload with Other Features\n        Input: Test file uploads in conjunction with other features that depend on uploaded files (e.g., image processing, document storage).\n        Expected Outcome: Ensure the uploaded files are correctly processed and integrated with other system components.\n\n7\\. Performance Tests:\n\n    Test Case 7.1: Upload a Large Number of Files Concurrently\n        Input: Simulate multiple users uploading a large number of files simultaneously.\n        Expected Outcome: The system should handle concurrent uploads without significant performance degradation or crashes.\n\n8\\. Stress Tests:\n\n    Test Case 8.1: Upload Files Continuously for an Extended Period\n        Input: Continuously upload files for an extended period to assess system stability.\n        Expected Outcome: The system should not experience memory leaks, crashes, or performance degradation during this stress test.\n```", "```py\nAct as a professional software tester and suggest test ideas for the feature delimited by three hashes.
