    NLP is a subfield of *artificial intelligence* (AI) that concerns computational
    approaches to processing, understanding, and generating human languages. NLP is
    used in many technologies you interact with in your daily life—spam filtering,
    conversational assistants, search engines, and machine translation. This first
    part of the book is intended to give you a gentle introduction to the field and
    bring you up to speed with how to build practical NLP applications.

    NLP, what is not NLP, how NLP technologies are used, and how it’s related to other
    fields of AI.

    an hour with the help of a powerful NLP framework, AllenNLP. You’ll also learn
    to use basic machine learning (ML) concepts, including *word embeddings* and *recurrent
    neural networks* (RNNs). Don’t worry if this sounds intimidating—we’ll introduce
    you to the concepts gradually and provide an intuitive explanation.

    deep learning approaches to NLP—word and sentence embeddings. The chapter demonstrates
    how to use and even train them using your own data.

    labeling. Though simple, these tasks have a wide range of applications, including
    sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
