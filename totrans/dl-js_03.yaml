    from prior experience with either web frontend development or Node.js-based backend
    development, and wish to venture into the world of deep learning. It aims to satisfy
    the learning needs of the following two subgroups of readers:'

- en: JavaScript programmers who aspire to go from little-to-no experience with machine
    learning or its mathematical background, to a decent knowledge of how deep learning
    works and a practical understanding of the deep-learning workflow that is sufficient
    for solving common data-science problems such as classification and regression

- en: For the first group of readers, this book develops the basic concepts of machine
    learning and deep learning in a ground-up fashion, using JavaScript code examples
    that are fun and ready for fiddling and hacking. We use diagrams, pseudo-code,
    and concrete examples in lieu of formal mathematics to help you form an intuitive,
    yet firm, grasp of the foundations of how deep learning works.

- en: For the second group of readers, we cover the key steps of converting existing
    models (e.g., from Python training libraries) into a web- and/or Node-compatible
    format suitable for deployment in the frontend or the Node stack. We emphasize
    practical aspects such as optimizing model size and performance, as well as considerations
    for various deployment environments ranging from a server to browser extensions
    and mobile apps.

    deep learning in JavaScript.

    are your gentle on-ramp to machine learning. [Chapter 2](kindle_split_013.html#ch02)
    works through a simple problem of predicting a single number from another number
    by fitting a straight line (linear regression) and uses it to illustrate how backpropagation
    (the engine of deep learning) works. [Chapter 3](kindle_split_014.html#ch03) builds
    on [chapter 2](kindle_split_013.html#ch02) by introducing nonlinearity, multi-layered
    networks, and classification tasks. From this chapter you will gain an understanding
    of what nonlinearity is, how it works, and why it gives deep neural networks their
    expressive power.'

- en: This book contains many examples of source code both in numbered listings and
    in line with normal text. In both cases, source code is formatted in a `fixed-width
    font like this` to separate it from ordinary text. Sometimes code is also **`in
    bold`** to highlight code that has changed from previous steps in the chapter,
    such as when a new feature adds to an existing line of code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many cases, the original source code has been reformatted; we’ve added line
    breaks and reworked indentation to accommodate the available page space in the
    book. In rare cases, even this was not enough, and listings include line-continuation
    markers (![](arrow.jpg)). Additionally, comments in the source code have often
    been removed from the listings when the code is described in the text. Code annotations
    accompany many of the listings, highlighting important concepts. The code for
    the examples in this book is available for download from GitHub at [https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples).
