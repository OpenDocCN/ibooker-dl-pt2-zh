- en: It is difficult to name a company that has not adopted machine learning into
    its workflow. Tech giants like Google, Airbnb, and Twitter and even small startups
    are using machine learning to fuel their systems and products in both subtle and
    obvious ways. If you see an advertisement on Google or see an eye-catching listing
    on Airbnb, ML is at the heart of driving those decisions. And TensorFlow is an
    enabler for developing solutions for these machine learning use cases. In other
    words, TensorFlow is a deep learning framework that manages almost all the stages
    of a modelâ€™s life cycle, from development and deployment to monitoring performance.

- en: In part 1, you will be introduced to the TensorFlow framework. We will provide
    a gentle introduction to this versatile framework. We will first go through some
    high-level topics such as what machine learning is, how TensorFlow works, the
    Keras library, and how to handle data in TensorFlow. We will walk through simple
    scenarios to contextualize the knowledge gained during the discussions. We will
    look at basic versions of popular deep learning models such as fully connected
    networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and Transformer
    models.
