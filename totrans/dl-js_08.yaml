- en: Having covered the foundations, in this part of the book we dive into machine
    learning in a hands-on fashion, armed with TensorFlow.js. We start in [chapter
    2](kindle_split_013.html#ch02) with a simple machine-learning task—regression
    (predicting a single number)—and work toward more sophisticated tasks such as
    binary and multiclass classification in [chapters 3](kindle_split_014.html#ch03)
    and [4](kindle_split_015.html#ch04). In lockstep with task types, you’ll also
    see a gentle progression from simple data (flat arrays of numbers) to more complex
    ones (images and sounds). The mathematical underpinning of methods such as backpropagation
    will be introduced alongside concrete problems and the code that solves them.
    We eschew formal math in favor of more intuitive explanations, diagrams, and pseudo-code.
    [Chapter 5](kindle_split_016.html#ch05) discusses transfer learning, an efficient
    reuse of pretrained neural networks to adapt to new data, and presents an approach
    especially suited to the deep-learning browser environment.
