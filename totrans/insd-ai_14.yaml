  zh: 结语
- en: As we conclude our discovery of the fascinating world of artificial intelligence,
    we need to reflect on the journey we have taken together. Throughout the chapters
    of this book, we explored the various AI techniques, tracing their evolution from
    the early days of expert systems to the contemporary era of deep learning. What
    we’ve discovered is that all these techniques rely on lines of code and mathematical
    formulations. At its core, AI is a tool using algorithms to process and analyze
    vast amounts of data, thereby empowering machines to detect patterns, make predictions,
    and execute tasks that have traditionally required human intelligence. This ability
    to learn from data lies at the heart of AI’s power. Unfortunately, misinformation,
    fueled by sensationalism, distorted the public’s perception, fostering unrealistic
    expectations and speculative fears while minimizing the remarkable ways it can
    enhance our lives.

  zh: 当我们结束对人工智能迷人世界的探索时，我们需要反思我们一起走过的旅程。在本书的各章中，我们探讨了各种人工智能技术，追溯了它们从专家系统早期到深度学习的当代时代的演变。我们发现的是，所有这些技术都依赖于代码和数学公式。在其核心，人工智能是一种利用算法处理和分析大量数据的工具，从而赋予机器检测模式、做出预测和执行传统上需要人类智慧的任务的能力。从数据中学习的能力是人工智能力量的核心。不幸的是，由于耸人听闻的报道，误导了公众的看法，培养了不切实际的期望和投机的恐惧，而忽视了它可以提升我们生活的显著方式。
- en: AI stands as a powerful tool with the potential to significantly improve our
    quality of life. However, the realization of its profound impact depends on how
    effectively we utilize it. It is crucial to approach its deployment with a nuanced
    understanding of both its capabilities and limitations. By embracing a comprehensive
    perspective, we can unlock the true potential of AI, navigating its complexities
    responsibly and ethically to ensure that its benefits are maximized while potential
    drawbacks are mitigated.

  zh: 人工智能作为一种强大的工具，具有显著改善我们生活质量的潜力。然而，其深远影响的实现取决于我们如何有效地利用它。以一种细致理解其能力和局限性的方式来部署它至关重要。通过全面的视角，我们可以释放人工智能的真正潜力，负责任和道德地引导其复杂性，确保其好处最大化，同时减轻潜在的缺点。
- en: For more than three decades, my passion for AI has been a driving force, propelling
    me to apply AI to real-world, mission-critical applications. In writing this book,
    my primary aspiration has been to demystify AI for those new to the field. It
    is my hope that, through these pages, you’ve gained the knowledge needed to distinguish
    between the myths surrounding AI and its tangible reality.

    the common tendency to inflate the significance of one’s achievements. He offered
    the following brilliant but sober description of AI [1]:'

  zh: 约瑟夫·魏岑鲍姆，第一个聊天机器人ELIZA的创造者，似乎避免了夸大自己成就的常见倾向。他对人工智能的以下精彩但冷静的描述如下[1]：
- en: Machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even
    the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked, once
    its inner workings are explained in language sufficiently plain to induce understanding,
    its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures,
    each quite comprehensible.

  zh: 机器被制造成以奇妙的方式行为，往往足以使即使是最有经验的观察者也感到眼花缭乱。但是一旦一个特定的程序被揭示，一旦它的内部运作被用足以引起理解的简单语言解释出来，它的魔力就会崩溃；它被揭示为一组简单易懂的程序。
- en: Weizenbaum’s characterization remains as accurate today in 2024 as it was in
    1965\. AI systems still have no reasoning skills, and they will not be replacing
    us any time soon in tasks requiring intellectual ability, physical agility, common
    sense, judgment, creativity, social relationships, or complex reasoning.

  zh: 1965 年约瑟夫·魏岑鲍姆的描述在 2024 年仍然如此准确。人工智能系统仍然没有推理能力，它们不会很快在需要智力、身体敏捷、常识、判断力、创造力、社交关系或复杂推理的任务中取代我们。
- en: My years working in the field of artificial intelligence have greatly increased
    my appreciation of and respect for human emotion and intelligence. Most of our
    mental abilities are beyond our powers of introspection and comprehension. If
    we think of our body as our hardware and our mind as our software, we represent
    a technology far more advanced than anything we could hope to create ourselves.

  zh: 我在人工智能领域工作多年，大大增加了我对人类情感和智慧的欣赏和尊重。我们大多数的心智能力超出了我们的自省和理解能力。如果我们将我们的身体看作硬件，我们的思维看作软件，我们代表着一种比我们所希望创造的任何东西都要先进得多的技术。
- en: Emerging AI technologies hold the potential to empower humanity in profound
    ways, transcending the boundaries of healthcare, education, engineering, agriculture,
    and myriad other domains. However, it’s imperative to acknowledge that AI is not
    an omnipotent panacea. It is a potent tool, and its usage will reflect both the
    noble and the nefarious facets of human ingenuity.

  zh: 新兴的人工智能技术有潜力以深远方式赋予人类力量，超越医疗保健、教育、工程、农业和其他领域的界限。然而，必须承认人工智能并非万能良药。它是一个强大的工具，其使用将反映人类智慧的高贵和卑鄙的两面。
- en: AI’s trajectory will involve military applications, surveillance mechanisms,
    cyber warfare, disinformation campaigns, and even oppressive uses. However, I
    am confident that the intelligence amplification resulting from the combination
    of human ingenuity and the dazzling speed of machines will increase economic prosperity
    by creating new opportunities for researchers and entrepreneurs to build new products,
    create more jobs, and apply them for the greater good.
