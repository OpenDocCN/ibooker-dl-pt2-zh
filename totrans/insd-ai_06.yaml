    that even if AI systems have shown impressive prowess in pattern recognition and
    data analysis, the essence of human ingenuity remains an enigma that is hard to
    replicate with algorithms. We will examine a few facets of human cognition to
    highlight what it truly means to be imaginative, intuitive, curious, and creative,
    demonstrating that while current AI can considerably augment our abilities, it
    can’t emulate many characteristics that are fundamental to the human brain’s capacity
    to imagine the unknown, to synthesize the abstract, and to derive inspiration
    from our thoughts and emotions. We will also demonstrate that true understanding
    is a prerequisite for vision, shedding light on the current constraints of AI
    algorithms in recognizing objects and their considerable distance from achieving
    a human-like perception of objects and scenes.

    remain a profound mystery, and we have yet to fully grasp the nature of thoughts
    or how we extract meaning from our sensory experiences. As humans, we engage in
    thinking when we encounter questions without immediate answers or when we rely
    on our knowledge to formulate responses. For instance, when asked to multiply
    5 by 4, the answer 20 comes effortlessly and instantaneously. Similarly, spelling
    our own name is an automatic response. However, when faced with more complex tasks
    like calculating the square root of 529 or spelling challenging words like *onomatopoeia*,
    we often need to engage in deliberate thought. It seems that we turn to thinking
    when we must adapt to unfamiliar situations.

    all harmoniously collaborating with one another. These cellular components concurrently
    execute thousands of functions, including transporting oxygen, circulating blood,
    digesting food, and synthesizing proteins. Our sensory organs constantly transmit
    information to the brain, providing us with the sensations of sight, sound, smell,

    by relaying instructions from the brain to muscles. All remaining neuron types
    are collectively referred to as interneurons. Within these three classes, numerous
    subclasses exist, each specializing in specific types of message transmission.
    Depending on their location and function, neurons from one subclass can occasionally
    assume the roles of others by transmitting and receiving specific neurotransmitters.'

    center, controlling its functions and containing its genetic material. The axon,
    resembling a lengthy tail, primarily carries electrochemical impulses away from
    the cell body, facilitating communication with other neurons. Dendrites, with
    their branching structures, receive incoming signals from neighboring neurons.
    Neurons communicate through the transmission of neurotransmitters across specialized

    modified the network of synapses connecting their cells. These changes in electrochemical
    pathways used by the cells to transmit and receive messages were linked to the
    formation of new memories. Today, we can observe how a cell nucleus generates
    mRNA that instructs synapses to establish new connections, and we now understand
    that these changes occur within our own brains when we learn or remember.

    an apple dropping from a tree, Newton had a profound intuition that there was
    something significant behind this seemingly ordinary event. This led him to ponder
    the nature of objects in motion, with his intuition suggesting that whatever caused
    the apple’s fall might also be responsible for the moon’s motion. He further inferred
    that such a universal force might also govern the movements of the stars and planets.
    In his time, the common belief was that angels pushed planets along their orbits.

    resorts to finding cases with facts that are analogous to his own in formulating
    an argument. One method of finding an analogy is through generalization of a legal
    rule. Although in one case a rule was applied to a specific set of facts, the
    language in which the court stated the rule may deductively allow its application
    to a different set of facts. The rule may use words that are capable of encompassing
    a variety of events, actions, or relationships. In our Boston Ice example, for
    instance, the lawyer examined whether the case of water delivery would hold for
    ice deliveries. In addition, analogies are found by generalizing on the factual

    world around us. Our visual perception begins with light from the environment,
    which either originates from a light source or bounces off objects before entering
    our eyes through the corneas. The eyes’ lenses focus this light onto the retinas,
    which are light-sensitive membranes located at the back of our eyes. Retinal cells
    respond by transmitting nerve signals to the brain, where they are rapidly processed
    into a representation of our surroundings. This perceptual process enables us
    to perceive lightness and darkness; distinguish colors, textures, and shapes;
    and identify distinct objects. Additionally, we can detect motion and estimate
    distances.

    of something. When a child sees a cat for the first time, they instinctively create
    a mental model that helps them recognize “cat-ness.” They use logic and common
    sense to generalize their observations, unconsciously identifying various characteristics
    associated with cats, such as shapes, colors, textures, sounds, and behaviors.
    Even if the child’s first encounter is with a small, white Siamese cat in a window,
    they will recognize other cats of different colors, sizes, and breeds, even when
    in various activities. They can identify cats in photographs, cartoons, and even
    when someone dresses as a cat for Halloween. With more exposure, they may learn
    that cats have claws and sharp teeth and can exhibit both sweet and temperamental
    behavior.

- en: In contrast, deep learning algorithms typically require exposure to millions
    of human-labeled examples before they can reliably identify a picture as “cat”
    or “not cat.” These examples need to be in high-resolution images. The algorithms
    need to see cats from multiple angles and engaged in various activities, capturing
    all relevant shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. To a machine, the objects it
    “sees” are essentially collections of pixels. Machine learning follows a hierarchical
    approach, initially recognizing patterns related to shape, then identifying color
    and texture, and eventually detecting finer features. Even when an AI system can
    reliably “see” and identify images of cats, it lacks the depth of understanding
    a child achieves after their first encounter with a cat. As discussed in our exploration
    of neural networks and deep learning in chapter 3, what machines “learn” is essentially
    a set of numerical values between 0 and 1 (the network’s weights) that enable
    the algorithm to produce accurate outputs most of the time. However, these numbers
    cannot teach a machine the *meaning* of an image or the potential uses of an object

    meaningful information that we trust so thoroughly that we regularly stake our
    lives on it. In contrast, a 2017 experiment with a deep learning system showed
    how fragile computer “vision” really is. After training the network to recognize
    a set of images, it was found that 74 percent of the images could be modified
    in just 1 pixel in a way that had a 99 percent chance of fooling the algorithm
    [16]. It’s interesting to note in passing that each of our eyes has a literal
    blind spot, and although it represents a much more significant gap in our field
    of vision than a single pixel, we are normally completely oblivious to it, and
    it causes us no confusion. The spot on the back of each eye where the retinal
    nerve attaches has no light-sensing cells, so the light from our environment that
    gets focused by an eye’s lens on one of those spots doesn’t stimulate any signal.
    The brain, however, represents our surroundings as a continuous, gapless image
    by using context and data from the other eye to fill in the missing information.
