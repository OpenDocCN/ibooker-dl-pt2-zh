- en: The authors of this book believe that businesses and research facilities working
    in the field of AI have a big role to play in making AI more accessible—by sharing
    the outcomes of their research and development with a broader audience, much as
    OpenAI has done with GPT-3 in the form of its publicly available API. Making such
    a powerful tool available at marginal cost to users in important fields can have
    a long-lasting positive impact on the world.

    programming leverage GPT-3 to move from ideas to working products. It’s a great
    example of how GPT-3 and large language models are changing jobs, economies, and
    futures. Then we’ll finish up with some takeaways for you to consider as you begin
    your GPT-3 journey.

- en: At its simplest, no-code is a way of programming computers—creating websites,
    mobile apps, programs, or scripts—using a simple interface, instead of writing
    in a programming language. The no-code movement, often [hailed](https://oreil.ly/FPCcw)
    as the [“future of coding”](https://oreil.ly/Iy4ZL), rests upon the fundamental
    belief that technology should enable and facilitate creation, not act as a barrier
    to entry for those who want to develop software. The no-code movement’s goal is
    to make it possible for anyone to create programs and apps that work, without
    programming skills or specialized equipment. This mission seems to go hand in
    hand with the evolution of model-as-a-service and the overall trend toward democratizing
    AI.

    a pioneering visual programming language and app-development program that enables
    users to create full-fledged web applications without writing a single line of
    code. The ripples from its impact have put a whole new industry in motion. In
    the words of founder Josh Haas, Bubble is “a platform where users can just describe
    in simple language what they want and how they want it and can automate the development
    without any code.” Haas was inspired, he explains in an interview, by noticing
    a “huge mismatch between the number of people who want to create with technology,
    build websites, build web applications, and the resources available in the form
    of engineering talent.”

    (such as Twitter, Facebook, or Airbnb, to name a few of the largest) requires
    talent with extensive technical expertise. Independent would-be developers who
    start at the beginner level must learn to code from scratch before actually building
    anything. That takes time and effort. “It’s such a time-consuming process for
    most people that it poses a huge barrier to entry,” Haas says.

    or coding background, but who have a great application idea and want to build
    a company around it, must depend on those who have that expertise—and persuade
    them to work on their idea. Haas notes that, as you might expect, “it is very
    hard to convince someone to work just for equity on an unproven idea, even if
    it’s a good idea.”

- en: 'In-house talent is crucial, Haas argues: while it’s possible to work with independent
    contractors, this requires a lot of back and forth and often detracts from the
    product quality and experience. Haas’s goal in founding Bubble was to lower the
    technological barrier to entrepreneurs entering the market, and to make the learning
    curve for technological skills as quick and smooth as possible. What excites him
    about no-code tools, Haas says, is the possibility of “turning an ordinary individual
    into a programmer or a software developer.” Indeed, a staggering 40% of Bubble
    users have no coding background. While Haas allows that “prior experience in programming
    definitely helps to smooth the learning curve and reduce time to pick things up,”
    even users with no experience can reach full Bubble proficiency in a few weeks
    and create sophisticated applications.'

    moved from low-level programming languages (such as assembly, where you have to
    understand a specific machine language to give instructions), to abstract, high-level
    languages, like Python and Java (with syntax similar to that of English). Low-level
    languages offer granularity and flexibility, but moving to high-level programming
    makes it possible to develop software applications at scale in months, instead
    of years. Proponents of no-code take this further, arguing that no-code innovations
    could reduce that period even more, from months to days. “Today even many engineers
    are using Bubble to build applications because it’s faster and more direct,” Haas
    says, and he hopes to see this trend continue.'

- en: The people working to democratize AI—many of whom, we emphasize, come from non-technical
    backgrounds—are full of groundbreaking ideas, such as creating a universal language
    for human interactions with AI. Such a language would make it far easier for people
    without technical training to interact and build tools with AI. We can already
    see this powerful trend coming to life with the OpenAI API Playground user interface,
    which uses natural language and does not require coding skills. We believe that
    combining this idea with no-code applications could create a revolutionary outcome.

    to talk to the computer.” Bubble’s initial focus is developing a language that
    allows humans to communicate with computers about requirements, design, and other
    elements of programs. The second step will be to teach the computer how to use
    that language to interact with humans. Haas says, “Currently, you have to draw
    and assemble the workflow manually in Bubble in order to build something, but
    it would be amazing to accelerate it by typing the English description and it
    popping into existence for you.”'

    fully functional software applications. Integrating it with Codex (which you learned
    about in [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#gpt_three_for_corporations)) will, Haas predicts,
    result in an interactive no-code ecosystem that can understand the context and
    build an application from a simple English description. “I think that’s where
    no-code is eventually moving,” Haas says, “but the short-term challenge is the
    availability of training data. We have seen Codex work with JavaScript applications
    since there are massive public repositories of code that are supplemented with
    comments, notes, and everything else required for training an LLM.”

    as of this writing include AI2sql, a start-up that helps to generate SQL queries
    from plain English, automating an otherwise time-consuming process, and Writepy,
    which uses Codex to power a platform for learning Python and analyzing data using
    English.

    in an interface that smooths the learning curve and reduces the need for any prerequisites.
    LLMs are capable of understanding context much as humans do, and can thus generate
    code with just a nudge from humans. We’re just now seeing the “initial potential”
    of combining them, says Haas. “I’m pretty sure if you interview me in five years,
    we will be using them internally. The integration between the two will make no-code
    more expressive and easier to learn. It will become a bit smarter and have a sense
    of empathy for what users are trying to accomplish.”

    Copilot. This code generation product has the advantage of huge training datasets
    consisting of billions of lines of code in conventional programming languages
    like Python and JavaScript. Similarly, as no-code development picks up speed and
    more and more applications are created, their code will become part of the training
    data for a large language model. The logical connections between the visual components
    of no-code application logic and the generated code will serve as a vocabulary
    for the model training process. This vocabulary can then be fed to an LLM to generate
    a fully functional application with high-level textual descriptions. “It’s basically
    a matter of time until it becomes technically feasible,” says Haas.

    easier across the board. Model-as-a-service is a burgeoning field where powerful

    with either these models or AI in general will decrease rapidly.” Early versions
    of tools like TensorFlow had little documentation and were “super cumbersome,”
    he explains, so “just the level of comfort we have right now in coding is amazing.”
    He cites tools like the Hugging Face Hub and Gradio alongside the OpenAI API,
    noting that such tools offer a “separation of concerns: ‘I am not good at running
    the model. I’m just going to let someone else do that.’” There are potential disadvantages
    to model-as-a-service, however: Kilcher notes the possibility that APIs and similar
    tools can create a “choke point” where the end users will be bound to the growth
    of these tools.'
