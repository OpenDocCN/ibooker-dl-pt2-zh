- en: A machine learning system is more than just a model and a data set. In this
    part, you will walk through the steps of engineering an entire machine learning
    pipeline, starting from the steps involved in automation of feature engineering
    to hyperparameter optimization and experiment management.

- en: In chapter 9, you will explore the use cases around feature selection and feature
    engineering, learning from case studies to understand the kinds of features that
    can be created for the DC taxi data set.

- en: In chapter 10, you will adopt a PyTorch framework called PyTorch Lightning to
    minimize the amount of boilerplate engineering code in your implementation. In
    addition, you will ensure that you can train, validate, and test your PyTorch
    Lightning-based machine learning model.

- en: In chapter 11, you will integrate your machine learning model with the Optuna
    hyperparameter framework, training alternative models based on Optuna-suggested
    hyperparameter values and ranking the models according to their loss and metric
    performance.

- en: In chapter 12, you will package your machine learning model implementation into
    a Docker container in order to run the container through the various stages of
    the entire machine learning pipeline, starting from the development data set all
    the way to a trained model ready for production deployment.
