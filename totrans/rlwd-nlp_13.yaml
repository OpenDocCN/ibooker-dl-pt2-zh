- en: In parts 1 and 2, we learned a lot about the “modeling” part of the modern NLP,
    including word embeddings, RNNs, CNNs, and the Transformer. However, you still
    need to learn how to effectively train, serve, deploy, and interpret those models
    for building robust and practical NLP applications.

    everything that happens *outside* NLP models. The chapter covers how to deploy,
    serve, explain, and interpret NLP models.
