- en: A deep learning system can be assumed to be efficient if it can bridge two different
    worlds—research and prototyping with production operations. Teams who design such
    systems must be able to communicate with practitioners across these two worlds
    and work with the different sets of requirements and constraints that come from
    each. This requires a principled understanding of how the components in deep learning
    systems are designed and how they are expected to work in tandem. Very little
    of the existing literature covers this aspect of deep learning engineering. This
    information gap becomes an issue when junior software engineers are onboarded
    and expected to become effective deep learning engineers.

  zh: 如果一个深度学习系统能够连接两个不同的世界——研究和原型设计与生产运营，那么可以假定它是有效的。设计这种系统的团队必须能够与这两个世界中的从业者进行沟通，并处理来自每个世界的不同要求和约束。这需要对深度学习系统中的组件是如何设计的，以及它们预期如何协同工作有一个原则性的理解。现有文献很少涵盖深度学习工程的这一方面。当初级软件工程师入职并期望成为有效的深度学习工程师时，这种信息差距就会成为一个问题。
- en: Over the years, engineering teams have filled this void by using their acquired
    experience and ferreting out what they need to know from the literature. Their
    work has helped traditional software engineers build, design, and extend deep
    learning systems in a relatively short amount of time. So it was with great excitement
    that I learned that Chi and Donald, both of whom have led deep learning engineering
    teams, have taken the very important initiative of consolidating this knowledge
    and sharing it in the form of a book.

- en: A little more than a decade ago, we had the privilege of building some early
    end user–facing product features that were powered by artificial intelligence.
    It was a huge undertaking. Collecting and organizing data that would be fit for
    model training was not a usual practice at that time. Few machine learning algorithms
    were packaged as ready-to-use libraries. Performing experiments required running
    management manually and building out custom workflows and visualizations. Custom
    servers were made to serve each type of model. Outside of resource-intensive tech
    companies, almost every single new AI-powered product feature was built from scratch.
    It was a far-reaching dream that intelligent applications would one day become
    a commodity.

  zh: 十多年前，我们有幸开发了一些早期的面向最终用户的产品功能，这些功能由人工智能驱动。这是一项巨大的工程。在那个时候，收集和整理适合模型训练的数据并不是一种常见的做法。很少有机器学习算法被打包成可直接使用的库。进行实验需要手动运行管理，并构建自定义的工作流和可视化界面。定制服务器用来为每种类型的模型提供服务。除了那些资源密集型的科技公司外，几乎每一个新的人工智能产品功能都是从零开始构建的。智能应用程序有朝一日成为一种商品是一个遥不可及的梦想。
- en: After working with a few AI applications, we realized that we had been repeating
    a similar ritual each time, and it seemed to us that it made more sense to design
    a systematic way, with prototyping, for delivering AI product features to production.
    The fruit of this effort was PredictionIO, an open source suite of framework software
    that put together state-of-the-art software components for data collection and
    retrieval, model training, and model serving. Fully customizable through its APIs
    and deployable as services with just a few commands, it helped shorten the time
    required at every stage, from running data science experiments to training and
    deploying production-ready models. We were thrilled to learn that developers around
    the world were able to use PredictionIO to make their own AI-powered applications,
    resulting in some amazing boosts to their businesses. PredictionIO was later acquired
    by Salesforce to tackle a similar problem on an even larger scale.

    Microsoft even provide complete, hosted systems that make it possible for teams
    to collaborate on experimentation, prototyping, and production deployments at

- en: Still, as we work with teams to deliver deep learning–powered product features,
    there have been some recurring questions. Why is our deep learning system designed
    the way it is? Is this the best design for other specific use cases? We noticed
    that junior software engineers were the ones most often asking these questions,
    and we interviewed a few of them to find out why. They revealed that their conventional
    software engineering training did not prepare them to work effectively with deep
    learning systems. And when they looked for learning resources, they found only
    scant and scattered information on specific system components, with hardly any
    resources discussing the fundamentals of the software components, why they were
    put together the way they were, and how they worked together to form a complete
    system.

    evolved into manual-like learning material explaining the design principles of

    from both technical and product perspectives. We were told that our material helped
    to quickly ramp up new teammates and allowed traditional software engineers with
    no prior experience in building deep learning systems to get up to speed. We decided
    to share this learning material with a much larger audience, in the form of a
    book. We contacted Manning, and the rest was history.

- en: But the model does not act alone. To bring a product or service to fruition,
    a model needs to be situated within a system or platform (we use these terms interchangeably)
    that supports the model with various services and stores. It needs, for instance,
    an API, a dataset manager, and storage for artifacts and metadata, among others.
    So behind every team of deep learning model developers is a team of non–deep learning
    developers creating the infrastructure that holds the model and all the other

- en: The problem we have observed in the industry is that often the developers tasked
    with designing the deep learning system and components have only a cursory knowledge

    needs from system engineering, so they tend to follow generic approaches when
    building the system. For example, they might choose to abstract out all work related
    to deep learning model development to the data scientist and only focus on automation.
    So the system they build relies on a traditional job scheduling system or business
    intelligence data analysis system, which is not optimized for how deep learning
    training jobs are run, nor for deep learning-specific data access patterns. As
    a result, the system is hard to use for model development, and model shipping
    velocity is slow. Essentially, engineers who lack a profound understanding of
    deep learning are being asked to build systems to support deep learning models.

- en: There are 10 chapters and three appendixes (including one lab appendix) in this
    book. The first chapter explains what a deep learning project development cycle
    is and what a basic deep learning system looks like. The next chapters dive into
    each functional component of the reference deep learning system. Finally, the
    last chapter discusses how models are shipped to production. The appendix contains
    a lab session to allow readers to try out the sample deep learning system.

- en: Chapter 1 describes what a deep learning system is, the different stakeholders
    of the system, and how they interact with it to deliver deep learning features.
    We call this interaction the deep learning development cycle. Additionally, you
    will conceptualize a deep learning system, called a reference architecture, that
    contains all essential elements and can be adapted based on your requirements.

- en: We believe the best way to learn is by doing, practicing, and experimenting.
    To demo the design principles explained in this book and provide hands-on experience,
    we created a sample deep learning system and code lab. All the source code, set-up
    instructions, and lab scripts of the sample deep learning system are available
    on GitHub ([https://github.com/orca3/MiniAutoML](https://github.com/orca3/MiniAutoML)).
    You can also obtain executable snippets of code from the liveBook (online) version
    of this book at [https://livebook.manning.com/book/software-engineers-guide-to-deep-learning-system-design](https://livebook.manning.com/book/software-engineers-guide-to-deep-learning-system-design)

- en: The “hello world” lab (in appendix A) contains a complete, though simplified,
    mini deep learning system with the most essential components (dataset management,
    model training and serving). We suggest you try out the “hello world” lab after
    reading the first chapter of the book or do it before trying our sample services
    in this book. This lab also provides shell scripts and links to all the resources
    you need to get started.

- en: Besides the code lab, this book contains many examples of source code in numbered
    listings and in line with normal text. In both cases, the source code is formatted
    in a `fixed-width` `font` `like` `this` to separate it from ordinary text. Sometimes
    code is also **`in bold`** to highlight code that has changed from previous steps
    in the chapter, such as when a new feature adds to an existing line of code.

- en: In many cases, the original source code has been reformatted; we’ve added line
    breaks and reworked indentation to accommodate the available page space in the
    book. In rare cases, even this was not enough, and listings include line-continuation
    markers (➥). Additionally, comments in the source code have often been removed
    from the listings when the code is described in the text. Code annotations accompany
    many of the listings, highlighting important concepts.
