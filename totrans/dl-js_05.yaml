- en: The figure on the cover of *Deep Learning with JavaScript* is captioned “Finne
    Katschin,” or a girl from the Katschin tribe. The illustration is taken from a
    collection of dress costumes from various countries by Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur
    (1757-1810), titled *Costumes de Différents Pays,* published in France in 1797\.
    Each illustration is finely drawn and colored by hand. The rich variety of Grasset
    de Saint-Sauveur’s collection reminds us vividly of how culturally apart the world’s
    towns and regions were just 200 years ago. Isolated from each other, people spoke
    different dialects and languages. In the streets or in the countryside, it was
    easy to identify where they lived and what their trade or station in life was
    just by their dress.

    at the time, has faded away. It is now hard to tell apart the inhabitants of different
    continents, let alone different towns, regions, or countries. Perhaps we have
    traded cultural diversity for a more varied personal life—certainly for a more
    varied and fast-paced technological life.

    the inventiveness and initiative of the computer business with book covers based
    on the rich diversity of regional life of two centuries ago, brought back to life
    by Grasset de Saint-Sauveur’s pictures.
