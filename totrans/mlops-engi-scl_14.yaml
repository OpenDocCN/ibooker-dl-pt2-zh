    framework, factoring out boilerplate engineering code and paving the way to hyperparameter
    optimization support. In this chapter, you are going to adopt Optuna, a hyperparameter
    optimization framework, to progress beyond a trial-and-error approach to selection
    of your machine learning hyperparameter values. You will train a collection of
    DC taxi model instances based on the hyperparameter values selected using Optuna’s
    Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator(TPE) that fits a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
    to the hyperparameters in your machine learning system. The performance of these
    model instances is compared using various Optuna visualization plots.

    other HPO frameworks, Optuna includes a collection of gradient-free[¹](#pgfId-1011837)
    optimization algorithms that range from random search, and Bayesian optimization,
    to TPE. Optuna uses the concept of a *trial* to describe an instance of a process
    to compute the value of a loss function, for example an instance of an experiment
    on the DcTaxiModel model to compute its test loss based on a set of hyperparameter
    values.

    using a combination of suggest_categorical calls. First, the hyperparameter for
    the total number of hidden layers (num_layers) is assigned a value by Optuna based
    on a set of possible hidden layer quantities from the list in listing 11.2 with
    the integer values [11, 13, 17, 19]. Next, depending on the value selected by
    Optuna for the number of hidden layers (num_layers), the next suggest_categorical
    call is invoked multiple times by the for operator, once for each hidden layer.
    Each of the invocations changes the assignment to the layer variable and instantiates
    a new hyperparameter, for example num_hidden_layer_0_neurons for the first layer
    in the architecture, num_hidden_layer_1_neurons for the second, and so on, depending
    on the value of the number of hyperparameter layers (num_layers). The value for
    each of these hyperparameters (each describing the number of neurons per hidden
    layer) is assigned from a different suggest_categorical list, specified as [7,
    11, 13, 19, 23]. Ultimately, num_hidden_neurons resolves to a Python list with

    num_hidden_layer_0_neurons hyperparameters. Notice that in figure 11.2, the lines
    represent the individual trial configurations, with those of the darker shade
    corresponding to the trials with a lower value for the objective function. Hence,
    a collection of the darker lines that pass though a certain interval for a hyperparameter
    indicate that the hyperparameter interval deserves closer inspection and may warrant
    another iteration of HPO.

    its ability to generate insights about the outcomes in a study. Since the contour
    plot is limited to visualization of pairs of hyperparameter values, you will find
    yourself generating multiple contour plots, often based on hyperparameters selected
    from either the importance or the parallel coordinate plots. As an example, to
    contour plot the relationship among batch_size, lr, and the objective function,
    you can run
