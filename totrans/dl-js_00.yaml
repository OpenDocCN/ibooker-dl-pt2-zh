- en: When we started TensorFlow.js (TF.js), formerly called deeplearn.js, machine
    learning (ML) was done mostly in Python. As both JavaScript developers and ML
    practitioners on the Google Brain team, we quickly realized that there was an
    opportunity to bridge the two worlds. Today, TF.js has empowered a new set of
    developers from the extensive JavaScript community to build and deploy ML models
    and enabled new classes of on-device computation.

- en: TF.js would not exist in its form today without Shanqing, Stan, and Eric. Their
    contributions to TensorFlow Python, including the TensorFlow Debugger, eager execution,
    and build and test infrastructure, uniquely positioned them to tie the Python
    and JavaScript worlds together. Early on in the development, their team realized
    the need for a library on top of deeplearn.js that would provide high-level building
    blocks to develop ML models. Shanqing, Stan, and Eric, among others, built TF.js
    Layers, allowing conversion of Keras models to JavaScript, which dramatically
    increased the wealth of available models in the TF.js ecosystem. When TF.js Layers
    was ready, we released TF.js to the world.

    Carrie Cai and Philip Guo deployed a survey to the TF.js website. This book is
    in direct response to the study’s summary: “Our analysis found that developers’
    desires for ML frameworks extended beyond simply wanting help with APIs: more
    fundamentally, they desired guidance on understanding and applying the conceptual
    underpinnings of ML itself.”^([[1](#pref06fn1)])'

- en: '*Deep Learning with JavaScript* contains a mix of deep learning theory as well
    as real-world examples in JavaScript with TF.js. It is a great resource for JavaScript
    developers with no ML experience or formal math background, as well as ML practitioners
    who would like to extend their work into the JavaScript ecosystem. This book follows
    the template of *Deep Learning with Python*, one of the most popular applied-ML
    texts, written by the Keras creator, François Chollet. Expanding on Chollet’s
    work, *Deep Learning with JavaScript* does an amazing job building on the unique
    things that JavaScript has to offer: interactivity, portability, and on-device
    computation. It covers core ML concepts, but does not shy away from state-of-the-art
    ML topics, such as text translation, generative models, and reinforcement learning.
    It even gives pragmatic advice on deploying ML models into real-world applications
    written by practitioners who have extensive experience deploying ML to the real
    world. The examples in this book are backed by interactive demos that demonstrate
    the unique advantages of the JavaScript ecosystem. All the code is open-sourced,
    so you can interact with it and fork it online.'

- en: This book should serve as the authoritative source for readers who want to learn
    ML and use JavaScript as their main language. Sitting at the forefront of ML and
    JavaScript, we hope you find the concepts in this book useful and the journey
    in JavaScript ML a fruitful and exciting one.
