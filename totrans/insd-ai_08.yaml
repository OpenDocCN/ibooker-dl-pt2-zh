    Intelligence is on the brink of transforming business practices. They claim that

    address any emergencies. If a patient is losing blood, for example, that needs
    to be addressed immediately. Once any emergencies are addressed, any obvious diagnoses
    will be made. For example, a patient in an otherwise stable condition who came
    in saying that they fell and broke their arm is probably right about what’s wrong.
    Any decisive test would be administered to confirm the diagnosis, and the necessary
    treatment would be provided.

    for decisive facts that would suggest the correct diagnosis. A priority would
    be given to affordable, safe, noninvasive tests, and only when the more reasonable
    options fail to provide clarification would you resort to more extravagant measures.
    For example, if there is reason to suspect that a patient has bronchitis and it’s
    possible to test this hypothesis with a simple throat culture, you do the throat
    culture instead of ordering an MRI, which is a lengthy, expensive, uncomfortable
    procedure. You progress from likely hypotheses and reasonable testing procedures
    to less likely possibilities and less desirable procedures until the problem can
    be identified.

    the dawn of a new era, where machines could provide answers to all our questions.
    It was envisioned that Watson could swiftly analyze medical documents and correlate

    IBM’s acquisition of four health-data companies in the mid-2010s, totaling approximately
    $4 billion, seemed to position them perfectly to revolutionize healthcare through
    AI. However, by 2020, after investing billions in research and development, no

- en: It’s not quite clear what has gone wrong here, but the result makes no sense.
    The translation algorithm apparently made reference to a library of idioms compiled
    by humans, which is at least a good start. The French phrase “La goutte d’eau
    qui fait déborder le vase” literally means “The drop of water that made the vase
    overflow,” and its English equivalent is “The straw that broke the camel’s back.”
    Since the two French phrases only differ by two words, the algorithm must have
    replaced the familiar French idiom with its English equivalent and then substituted
    literal translations of the words that didn’t match the idiom.

    with the idioms and translate them correctly, or they would recognize that a literal
    translation doesn’t make sense and that they need to investigate. It’s quite likely,
    in fact, that they would be able to figure out from context what it must mean.
    The example should make clear that machines are still far from having this ability.

    translation tasks of all. These two languages are closely related, and there is
    a vast amount of training material available for any AI system. For example, since
    Canada’s Official Languages Act of 1969, all of their official documents have
    had to be available in both English and French. The European Commission has the
    same requirement. This must amount to at least hundreds of thousands of pages
    of text that have been carefully written and meticulously translated, and for
    many years now, most of this will have been available in electronic form.

    translate a common phrase from French to English, how much confidence could we
    place in its ability to translate between more enigmatic languages? We might still
    be decades away from the day when AI can passably translate poetry from Mandarin
    to Indonesian or literature from Vietnamese to Finnish, and quite possibly, that
    day might never come. Even the translation of more straightforward material in
    the legal or business domain will depend on humans for the foreseeable future.

- en: In brief, although there are ongoing concerns about AI potentially replacing
    human jobs, it’s important to acknowledge that AI has inherent limitations. AI
    faces significant obstacles when it comes to tasks that demand human qualities
    such as reasoning, physical abilities, emotional comprehension, creativity, and
    handling ambiguous situations. Furthermore, AI systems heavily rely on the data
    they are trained on, which can introduce biases, rendering them unsuitable for
    tasks demanding fairness and impartiality. Due to these limitations and their
    inherent lack of a true understanding of the world, AI is poised to complement
    rather than supplant humans. Consequently, AI is more likely to enhance human
    capabilities by handling repetitive and data-driven aspects of work, thereby increasing
    efficiency and allowing humans to focus on tasks that demand our unique qualities.

    the time being, we can address the ominous “singularity” referred to at the start
    of this chapter. Cue the sinister music, my friends. First they came for your
    jobs, and now the AI overlords are coming to take over civilization.
