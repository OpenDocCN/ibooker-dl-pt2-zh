    deep historical roots. As far back as 1589, when English inventor William Lee
    sought a patent for his knitting machine, Queen Elizabeth I denied it due to concerns
    about the economic stability of the kingdom’s numerous hand-knitters. This illustrates
    the long-standing fear of technological advancements affecting employment. In
    the appendix, we’ll briefly touch upon the Luddites and their reactionary actions
    against textile machinery during the 19th century. This moment in history underscores
    the resistance to automation, which often arises from concerns about job displacement.
    In July 1987, the *Harvard Business Review* published an article titled “Thinking
    about Artificial.” It opened with the statement: “Some believe that Artificial
    Intelligence is on the brink of transforming business practices. They claim that
    ‘intelligent’ computer programs will imminently assume roles such as doctors,
    lawyers, factory workers, and managers” [1]. As we know, none of these forecasts

    your body is probed by X-rays or microwaves, while sensors inspect the surface

    incipient disease. Although you feel nothing, see nothing, the inner workings

    address any emergencies. If a patient is losing blood, for example, that needs

    for decisive facts that would suggest the correct diagnosis. A priority would

    options fail to provide clarification would you resort to more extravagant measures.
    For example, if there is reason to suspect that a patient has bronchitis and it’s
    possible to test this hypothesis with a simple throat culture, you do the throat
    culture instead of ordering an MRI, which is a lengthy, expensive, uncomfortable
