    Over the past six years, Keras has grown to have hundreds of open source contributors
    and more than one million users. Your contributions and feedback have turned Keras
    into what it is today.

    to see Keras adopted as TensorFlow’s high-level API. A smooth integration between
    Keras and TensorFlow greatly benefits both TensorFlow users and Keras users and
    makes deep learning accessible to most.
