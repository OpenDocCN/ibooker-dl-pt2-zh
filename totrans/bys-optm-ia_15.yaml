- en: 'Gaussian processes (GPs), outside of the context of BayesOpt, are a powerful
    class of ML models in their own right. While the main topic of this book is BayesOpt,
    it would be a missed opportunity not to give GPs more attention. This part shows
    us how to extend GPs and make them more practical in various ML tasks, while retaining
    their most valuable feature: the quantification of uncertainty in the predictions.'

    to large data sets. This chapter helps us address one of the biggest disadvantages
    of GPs: their training cost.'

    them with neural networks. This combination offers the best of both worlds: the
    ability of neural networks to approximate any function and the quantification
    of uncertainty by GPs. This chapter is also where we can truly appreciate having
    a streamlined software ecosystem in PyTorch, GPyTorch, and BoTorch, which makes
    working with neural networks and GPs together seamless.'
