- en: A well-versed ML practitioner is a multifaceted individual. Not only do they
    need a good understanding of modern deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow,
    but they also need to be able to navigate the complex APIs offered by it to implement
    complex deep learning models to solve some of the common machine learning problems
    in domains like computer vision and natural language processing.

- en: In part 2, we look at real-world problems in both computer vision and natural
    language processing. First, we look at image classification and image segmentation,
    which are two popular computer vision tasks. For these tasks, we analyze modern
    complex deep learning models that have performed well on a given problem. Not
    only will we implement these models from scratch, we will understand the reasoning
    behind core design decisions and the advantages they bring about.

    analysis task and how deep learning can solve it. We also explore various corners
    of the solution, such as basic NLP preprocessing steps and using word vectors
    to enhance performance. We then look at language modeling: a pretraining task
    that gives the enormous language understanding enjoyed by state-of-the-art NLP
    models. In this discussion, we again discuss various techniques that are incorporated
    in language modeling to enhance the prediction quality.'
