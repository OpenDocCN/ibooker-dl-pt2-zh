- en: The most significant event in the recent history of technology is perhaps the
    explosion in the power of neural networks since 2012\. This was when the growth
    in labeled datasets, increases in computation power, and innovations in algorithms
    came together and reached a critical mass. Since then, deep neural networks have
    made previously unachievable tasks achievable and boosted the accuracies in other
    tasks, pushing them beyond academic research and into practical applications in
    domains such as speech recognition, image labeling, generative models, and recommendation
    systems, just to name a few.

- en: It was against this backdrop that our team at Google Brain started developing
    TensorFlow.js. When the project started, many regarded “deep learning in JavaScript”
    as a novelty, perhaps a gimmick, fun for certain use cases, but not to be pursued
    with seriousness. While Python already had several well-established and powerful
    frameworks for deep learning, the JavaScript machine-learning landscape remained
    splintered and incomplete. Of the handful of JavaScript libraries available back
    then, most only supported deploying models pretrained in other languages (usually
    in Python). For the few that supported building and training models from scratch,
    the scope of supported model types was limited. Considering JavaScript’s popular
    status and its ubiquity that straddles client and server sides, this was a strange
    situation.

- en: TensorFlow.js is the first full-fledged industry-quality library for doing neural
    networks in JavaScript. The range of capabilities it provides spans multiple dimensions.
    First, it supports a wide range of neural-networks layers, suitable for various
    data types ranging from numeric to text, from audio to images. Second, it provides
    APIs for loading pretrained models for inference, fine-tuning pretrained models,
    and building and training models from scratch. Third, it provides both a high-level,
    Keras-like API for practitioners who opt to use well-established layer types,
    and a low-level, TensorFlow-like API for those who wish to implement more novel
    algorithms. Finally, it is designed to be runnable in a wide selection of environments
    and hardware types, including the web browser, server side (Node.js), mobile (e.g.,
    React Native and WeChat), and desktop (electron). Adding to the multidimensional
    capability of TensorFlow.js is its status as a first-class integrated part of
    the larger TensorFlow/Keras ecosystem, specifically its API consistency and two-way
    model-format compatibility with the Python libraries.

- en: The book you have in your hands will guide your grand tour through this multidimensional
    space of capabilities. We’ve chosen a path that primarily cuts through the first
    dimension (modeling tasks), enriched by excursions along the remaining dimensions.
    We start from the relatively simpler task of predicting numbers from numbers (regression)
    to the more complex ones such as predicting classes from images and sequences,
    ending our trip on the fascinating topics of using neural networks to generate
    new images and training agents to make decisions (reinforcement learning).

- en: We wrote the book not just as a recipe for how to write code in TensorFlow.js,
    but as an introductory course in the foundations of machine learning in the native
    language of JavaScript and web developers. The field of deep learning is a fast-evolving
    one. It is our belief that a firm understanding of machine learning is possible
    without formal mathematical treatment, and this understanding will enable you
    to keep yourself up-to-date in future evolution of the techniques.

- en: With this book you’ve made the first step in becoming a member of the growing
    community of JavaScript machine-learning practitioners, who’ve already brought
    about many impactful applications at the intersection between JavaScript and deep
    learning. It is our sincere hope that this book will kindle your own creativity
    and ingenuity in this space.
