    one, you can struggle with limitations and inflexibility from then on. Further,
    you have to choose a quality hosting service. It stores your site on a server

    will use. Recall that WordPress *can* be installed on your hard drive, but that
    isn’t recommended. You would have to handle technical issues such as security,
    uptime, and many other tasks best left to a WordPress hosting service located

    support when something goes wrong.

    [WordPress.com](wordpress.com.html). But that free version has limitations—no
    plugins allowed, for example. However, for small, simple, personal blogs it can
    be sufficient. WordPress.com does also offer premium, paid plans, but many reviewers
    say they’re not good value when compared to independent hosting services like
    [SiteGround.com](eu.siteground.com.html), [Bluehost.com](www.bluehost.com.html)

    To* speed up the display of a page, hosting services cache (store) pages from
    your site that were previously displayed. When that same page is requested again,
    the host can just slap that already rendered, cached page onto the visitor’s screen.
    This avoids the delay caused by the rendering process. (To display a fresh page,
    the browser must perform a variety of tasks--fetching images from your WordPress
    Media Library, looking at any CSS code to see if a font size, for example, differs
    from what the theme’s CSS style sheet specifies, scanning HTML code to figure
    out where to position the page elements, and so on. So you’ll want a host that
    caches its sites’ pages efficiently.)

    means they offer multiple servers around the world to store your site. Your pages
    load more quickly if the server hosting your site is located at least on the same
    continent as your primary audience. Many people who might otherwise join your
    audience simply won’t tolerate sluggish page-load times. And some in your audience
    have slow internet connections. For them, page-load speed is a major consideration

    you make. WordPress doesn’t do that. Instead, when you modify content in a page
    in your site, you must click the Update button (or several synonyms that WordPress
    displays). Here’s one problem with those synonyms: When you first create a new
    page in WordPress, the button that saves your work is captioned *Publish*. Then
    that same button changes to Update. It’s not good UI design to change the name
    of a button. Beginners are often confused by this. It would be an improvement

  prefs: []

    buttons that save your work are confusing because they have different meanings.
    It’s just something you have to get used to. For one thing, *publish* normally
    means *make public*. In other words, you would think that clicking Publish means
    that your audience can now see the most recent version of a page you just modified.
    But that’s not always so. If the page is cached (stored for future display), they
    won’t necessarily see the new version, particularly if the caching algorithm considers
    the modification minor.
