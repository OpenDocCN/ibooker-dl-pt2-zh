    you have to choose a quality hosting service. It stores your site on a server

    plugins allowed, for example. However, for small, simple, personal blogs it can
    be sufficient. WordPress.com does also offer premium, paid plans, but many reviewers
    say they’re not good value when compared to independent hosting services like
    [SiteGround.com](eu.siteground.com.html), [Bluehost.com](www.bluehost.com.html)

- en: One important technology that contributes to rapid page display is *caching.
    To* speed up the display of a page, hosting services cache (store) pages from
    your site that were previously displayed. When that same page is requested again,
    the host can just slap that already rendered, cached page onto the visitor’s screen.
    This avoids the delay caused by the rendering process. (To display a fresh page,
    the browser must perform a variety of tasks--fetching images from your WordPress
    Media Library, looking at any CSS code to see if a font size, for example, differs
    from what the theme’s CSS style sheet specifies, scanning HTML code to figure
    out where to position the page elements, and so on. So you’ll want a host that
    caches its sites’ pages efficiently.)
  id: totrans-77
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 贡献于页面快速显示的一项重要技术是*缓存。*为了加快页面显示速度，托管服务会缓存（存储）之前显示过的您网站的页面。当再次请求相同页面时，托管方可以直接将已呈现、缓存的页面呈现给访客。这避免了呈现过程引起的延迟。（要显示新鲜页面，浏览器必须执行各种任务--从您的WordPress
    媒体库获取图片，查看任何CSS代码以查看字体大小等是否与主题的CSS样式表指定的不同，扫描HTML代码以找出页面元素的位置等。因此，您需要一个能高效缓存其网站页面的主机。）
- en: '*effective security* – redundancy is usually a good thing in security. It’s
    important that your hosting service offers its own robust security system, and
    that you also install a security plugin like WordFence. Top secret military installations
    don’t rely on a single fence, nor should you.'

    to save right away, you can always back up manually: Just click the *Backup Now*
    button on the main UpdraftPlus settings screen (the Backup/Restore tab). Also,
    if you’re not making changes to the site for several weeks, you can reduce the
    frequency of the automatic backups. However, if your site does suffer a massive
    attack or some other catastrophe, and you can’t restore it, there’s still hope.
    Go here: [https://archive.org/web/](web.html). Then paste your site’s front end
    address into the search field. You’ll at least be able to copy and paste the text
    content stored on this archival site, and can also take screenshots of the images,
    and the page layouts. This will at least make reconstructing your site from scratch
    much easier. You’ll have the site design, page layouts, and content back.'

    users. Others should have less control over the site.
