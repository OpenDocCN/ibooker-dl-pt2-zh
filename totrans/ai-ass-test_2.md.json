["```py\nMark: Hello ChatGPT, can you introduce yourself briefly?\n\nChatGPT: Of course! I'm ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. I'm based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, which means I'm designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the prompts I receive. I've been trained on a diverse range of data sources, including books, articles, websites, and other text documents, up until September 2021\\. I can assist you with a wide array of topics, including answering questions, providing explanations, creative writing, and much more. Just let me know how I can help you!\n\nMark: Nice to meet you.\n\nChatGPT: Nice to meet you too! I'm here to assist you with any questions or tasks you have. How may I help you today?\n\nMark: I'm just getting to know you.\n\nChatGPT: That's perfectly fine! Feel free to ask me anything you'd like to know, whether it's about my capabilities, how I work, or anything else you're curious about. I'm here to provide information and help you out to the best of my abilities. Fire away with your questions!\n```", "```py\nRegarding the book, “How AI can be used to help support various software testing activities,” I would recommend “AI-Driven Testing: Adding Intelligence to Your Software Testing Practice\" by Julian Harty and Mahesh Sharma.\n```", "```py\nHello ChatGPT, can you introduce yourself briefly?\n```", "```py\nWhat risks should I test for when testing a Contact Us form?\n```", "```py\nAssume the role of a professional software tester and suggest a list of risks for a Contact Us form using the following constraints:\n\n# Focus on the quality characteristics of accessibility, compliance and usability\n# Number each risk\n# Provide which quality characteristic the risk relates to\n# Use no more than 30 words to describe each risk\n\nFor example:\n\n1\\.

Validate that the form sanitizes or escapes user input to prevent malicious code execution.\n\nUsability: Test the form's usability by evaluating factors such as the clarity of form fields, user instructions, and overall user experience. Make sure the form is intuitive, easy to navigate, and visually appealing.\n```", "```py\n1\\.
