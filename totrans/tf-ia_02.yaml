    a second by 2025 ([https://www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org)). Those tiny
    contributions we make using Google search queries, tweets, Facebook photos, and
    voice commands to Alexa will add up to unprecedented amounts of data. Therefore,
    there’s no better time than the present to fight on the frontier of artificial
    intelligence, to make sense of and most importantly leverage the ever-growing
    universe of digital data. It is a no-brainer that data itself is not very useful
    until we elicit information from it. For example, an image is more useful if the
    machine knows what’s in that image; a voice command is more useful if the machine
    can articulate/transcribe what was said. Machine learning is the gatekeeper that
    lets you cross from the world of data into the realm of information (e.g., actionable
    insights, useful patterns) by allowing machines to learn from data. Machine learning,
    particularly deep learning methods, deliver unparalleled performance in the presence
    of abundant data. With the explosive growth of data, more and more use cases will
    emerge for deep learning to be applied in. Of course, we cannot ignore the possibility
    of a better technique drowning the popular deep learning methods. However, it
    is an irrefutable reality that, to date, deep learning has been constantly outperforming
    other algorithms, particularly when ample data is present.

    This means TensorFlow needs to support many different capabilities and stages
    of a machine learning project. After a business problem is identified, any machine
    learning project starts with data. An important step is to perform exploratory
    data analysis. Typically, this is done using a mix of TensorFlow and other data
    manipulating libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy). In this step, we try to understand
    our data because that will determine how well we can use it to solve the problem.
    With a solid understanding of the data (e.g., data types, data-specific attributes,
    various cleaning/processing that needs to be done before feeding data to the model),
    the next step is to find an efficient way to consume data. TensorFlow provides
    a comprehensive API (application programming interface), known as the tf.data
    API (or tensorflow.data API) ([https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data)),
    that enables you to harness the data found in the wild. Specifically, this API

- en: Furthermore, Keras provides pretrained models that can be downloaded and used
    conveniently. As Theano retired in 2017, TensorFlow became the go-to backend for
    Keras. In 2017 (TensorFlow v1.4 upward), Keras was integrated into TensorFlow
    and is now a submodule in TensorFlow that provides a wide variety of reusable
    layers that can be used to build deep learning models as well as pretrained models.

- en: Using any of these elements (or a combination of them), you can write a data-processing
    pipeline (e.g., a Python script). Data would vary depending on the problem you
    are trying to solve. For example, in an image recognition task, data would be
    images and their respective classes (e.g., dog/cat). For a sentiment analysis
    task, the data would be movie reviews and their respective sentiments (e.g., positive/negative/neutral).
    The purpose of this pipeline is to produce a batch of data from these data sets.
    The data sets typically fed to deep learning models can have tens of thousands
    (if not more) data points and would never fit fully in limited computer memory,
    so we feed a small batch of data (e.g., few hundred data points) at a time and
    iterate through the full data set in batches.

- en: 'Next up is the model-building phase. Deep learning models come in many flavors
    and sizes. There are four main types of deep networks: fully connected, convolutional
    neural, recurrent neural, and Transformer. These models have different capabilities,
    strengths, and weaknesses, as you will see in later chapters. TensorFlow also
    offers different APIs that have varying degrees of control for building models.
    First, in its most raw form, TensorFlow provides various primitive operations
    (e.g., matrix multiplication) and data structures to store inputs and outputs
    of the models (e.g., n-dimensional tensors). These can be used as building blocks
    to implement any deep learning models from the ground up.'

    还提供了不同的 API，用于构建模型的控制程度各不相同。首先，在其最原始的形式中，TensorFlow 提供了各种基本操作（例如矩阵乘法）和用于存储模型输入和输出的数据结构（例如
    n 维张量）。这些可以用作构建块，从零开始实现任何深度学习模型。

    is guaranteed by a very restricted API, exposing the user to the bare minimum
    functionality to train, predict from, and evaluate models.

    This graph is a representation of what your model looks like and the operations
    it executes. Then, if you have optimized hardware (e.g., a GPU), TensorFlow will
    identify those devices and place parts of this graph on that special hardware
    so that any operations you run on the model are executed as quickly as possible.

    the tf.data API. The model’s training process is critical, as for deep learning
    models, it is quite time-consuming, so you need a way to periodically monitor
    the progress of the model and make sure the performance stays at a reasonable
    level during the course of training. For that we write the loss value, the evaluation
    metric for performance on both training and validation data, so if something goes
    wrong, you can intervene as soon as possible. There are more advanced tools in
    TensorFlow that will allow you to monitor the performance and health of your model
    with more options and convenience. TensorBoard ([https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard))
    is a visualization tool that comes with TensorFlow and can be used to visualize
    various model metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, etc.) while the model is trained.
    All you need to do is log the metrics you’d like to visualize to a directory and
    then start the TensorBoard server, providing the directory as an argument. TensorBoard
    will automatically visualize the logged metrics on a dashboard. This way, if something
    goes wrong, you’ll quickly notice it, and the logged metrics will help pinpoint
    any issues with the model.

    loss 值，这是对训练和验证数据性能的评估指标，因此如果出现问题，你可以尽快介入。TensorFlow 中有更高级的工具，可以让你以更多选项和便利的方式监视模型的性能和健康状况。TensorBoard（[https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard)）是一个随

- en: After (or even during) the training process, you need to save the model; otherwise,
    it will be destroyed right after you exit the Python program. Also, if your training
    process gets interrupted during training, you can restore the model and continue
    training (if you saved it). In TensorFlow you can save models in several ways.
    You can simply save a model in HDF5 format (i.e., a format for large file storage).
    Another recommended method is saving it as a SavedModel ([https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model)),

    is designed to get a few people (e.g., four) quickly to a destination (i.e., low
    latency). On the other hand, a bus is slow but carries more people (e.g., 60)
    in a single trip (i.e., high throughput). Additionally, a car is fitted with various
    sensors and equipment that will make your drive/ride comfortable (e.g., parking
    sensors, lane detection, seat heaters, etc.). But the design of a bus would focus
    more on providing basic needs (e.g., seats, stop buttons, etc.) for a lot of people
    with limited options to make your ride joyful (figure 1.1).

    support a variety of operations, CPUs need to support a large set of instructions.
    And to make these run fast, a CPU relies on expensive infrastructure (e.g., more
    transistors, different levels of caches, etc.). To summarize, CPUs execute a large
    set of instructions very fast at a small scale. In contrast, a typical GPU has

    to an optimized hardware list. TPUs were invented by Google and can be thought
    of as stripped-down GPUs. They are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)
    targeted for machine learning and AI applications. They were designed for low-precision
    high-volume operations. For example, a GPU typically uses 32-bit precision, whereas
    a TPU uses a special data type known as *bfloat16* (which uses 16 bits) ([http://mng.bz/QWAe](http://mng.bz/QWAe)).
    Furthermore, TPUs lack graphic-processing capabilities such as rasterizing/ texture
    mapping. Another differentiating characteristic of TPUs is that they are much
    smaller compared to GPUs, meaning more TPUs can be fit in a smaller physical space.

    data. These are libraries that are equipped with highly optimized C/C++ implementations
    of various data manipulation (e.g., indexing, filtering, grouping) and statistics-related
    operations (e.g., mean, sum). For a small data set, TensorFlow can cause significant
    overhead (transferring data between the CPU and the GPU, launching computational
    kernels on the GPU), especially if a high volume of smaller, less expensive operations
    is run. Additionally, pandas/NumPy would be much more expressive in terms of how

    pass data to the model without doing at least simple preprocessing on the data
    (e.g., text lowering, removing punctuation). But the actual steps that dictate
    your preprocessing pipeline will depend on your use case and your model. For example,
    there will be instances where you will have a handful of simple steps (e.g., case
    lowering, removing punctuation), or you might have a fully blown preprocessing
    pipeline that requires complex tasks (e.g., stemming, lemmatizing, correcting
    spelling). In the former case, TensorFlow is a good choice as it provides some
    simple text preprocessing functionality (e.g., case lowering, replacing text,
    string splitting, etc.). However, in the latter case, where costly steps such
    as lemmatization, stemming, spelling correction, and so on dominate the preprocessing
    pipeline, TensorFlow will hinder your progress. For this, spaCy ([https://spacy.io/](https://spacy.io/))
