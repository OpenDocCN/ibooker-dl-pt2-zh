    Make sure you’re downloading the latest version (at the time of writing, it’s
    Python 3.x). Choose the appropriate version based on your system architecture
    (32-bit or 64-bit). Most modern computers are 64-bit, but you can confirm by right-clicking
    on "This PC" (or "My Computer") and selecting "Properties".
