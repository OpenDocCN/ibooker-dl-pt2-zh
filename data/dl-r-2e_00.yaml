  zh: 前言
- en: If you’ve picked up this book, you’re probably aware of the extraordinary progress
    that deep learning has represented for the field of artificial intelligence in
    the recent past. We went from near-unusable computer vision and natural language
    processing to highly performant systems deployed at scale in products you use
    every day. The consequences of this sudden progress extend to almost every industry.
    We’re already applying deep learning to an amazing range of important problems
    across domains as different as medical imaging, agriculture, autonomous driving,
    education, disaster prevention, and manufacturing.

  zh: 如果你拿起这本书，你可能已经意识到了近年来深度学习对人工智能领域所代表的非凡进步。我们从几乎无法使用的计算机视觉和自然语言处理到在你每天使用的产品中大规模部署的高性能系统。这一突然进步的后果影响几乎每个行业。我们已经将深度学习应用于跨越医学成像、农业、自动驾驶、教育、灾害预防和制造等不同领域的一系列重要问题。
- en: Yet, I believe deep learning is still in its early days. It has realized only
    a small fraction of its potential so far. Over time, it will make its way to every
    problem where it can help—a transformation that will take place over multiple
    decades.

  zh: 然而，我认为深度学习仍处于早期阶段。到目前为止，它只实现了其潜力的一小部分。随着时间的推移，它将走向能够帮助的每一个问题——这是一个需要几十年时间的转变。
- en: To begin deploying deep learning technology to every problem that it could solve,
    we need to make it accessible to as many people as possible, including non-experts—
    people who aren’t researchers or graduate students. For deep learning to reach
    its full potential, we need to radically democratize it. And today, I believe
    that we’re at the cusp of a historical transition, where deep learning is moving
    out of academic labs and the R&D departments of large tech companies to become
    a ubiquitous part of the toolbox of every developer out there—not unlike the trajectory
    of web development in the late 1990s. Almost anyone can now build a website or
    web app for their business or community of a kind that would have required a small
    team of specialist engineers in 1998\. In the not-so-distant future, anyone with
    an idea and basic coding skills will be able to build smart applications that
    learn from data.

  zh: 要开始将深度学习技术部署到每一个可以解决的问题上，我们需要让尽可能多的人包括非专家——那些不是研究人员或研究生的人——能够接触到它。为了使深度学习发挥其全部潜力，我们需要彻底民主化它。今天，我相信我们正处于一个历史性转变的关键时刻，深度学习正在从学术实验室和大型科技公司的研发部门走向成为每个开发者工具箱中无处不在的一部分——类似于上世纪90年代末的web开发轨迹。现在几乎任何人都可以建立一个网站或网络应用，而在1998年，这可能需要一个小团队的专业工程师。在不久的将来，任何有想法和基本编码技能的人都将能够构建能够从数据中学习的智能应用程序。
- en: When I released the first version of the Keras deep learning framework in March
    2015, the democratization of AI wasn’t what I had in mind. I had been doing research
    in machine learning for several years and had built Keras to help me with my own
    experiments. But since 2015, hundreds of thousands of newcomers have entered the
    field of deep learning; many of them picked up Keras as their tool of choice.
    As I watched scores of smart people use Keras in unexpected, powerful ways, I
    came to care deeply about the accessibility and democratization of AI. I realized
    that the further we spread these technologies, the more useful and valuable they
    become. Accessibility quickly became an explicit goal in the development of Keras,
    and over a few short years, the Keras developer community has made fantastic achievements
    on this front. We’ve put deep learning into the hands of hundreds of thousands
    of people, who in turn are using it to solve problems that were until recently
    thought to be unsolvable.

  zh: 当我在2015年3月发布了Keras深度学习框架的第一个版本时，AI的民主化并不是我的初衷。我已经在机器学习领域做了几年的研究，并建立了Keras来帮助我进行实验。但自2015年以来，成千上万的新人进入了深度学习领域；其中许多人选择了Keras作为他们的首选工具。当我看到许多聪明的人以意想不到的强大方式使用Keras时，我开始非常关心AI的可访问性和民主化。我意识到，我们传播这些技术的越广泛，它们就变得越有用和有价值。可访问性很快成为Keras开发的一个明确目标，在短短几年内，Keras开发者社区在这方面取得了巨大的成就。我们已经让数十万人掌握了深度学习，这些人又在解决一些直到最近被认为无法解决的问题。
- en: The book you’re holding is another step on the way to making deep learning available
    to as many people as possible. Keras had always needed a companion course to simultaneously
    cover the fundamentals of deep learning, deep learning best practices, and Keras
    usage patterns. In 2016 and 2017, I did my best to produce such a course, which
    became the first edition of this book, released in December 2017\. It quickly
    became a machine learning best seller that sold over 50,000 copies and was translated
    into 12 languages.

  zh: 你手中的这本书是让尽可能多的人了解深度学习的又一步。Keras一直需要一个配套课程，以同时涵盖深度学习的基础知识、深度学习最佳实践和Keras使用模式。在2016年和2017年，我尽力制作了这样一个课程，它成为了本书的第一版，于2017年12月发布。它迅速成为了一本机器学习畅销书，销量超过了5万册，并被翻译成了12种语言。
- en: However, the field of deep learning advances fast. Since the release of the
    first edition, many important developments have taken place—the release of TensorFlow
    2, the growing popularity of the Transformer architecture, and more. And so, in
    late 2019, I set out to update my book. I originally thought, quite naively, that
    it would feature about 50% new content and would end up being roughly the same
    length as the first edition. In practice, after two years of work, it turned out
    to be over a third longer, with about 75% novel content. More than a refresh,
    it is a whole new book.

  zh: 然而，深度学习领域发展迅速。自第一版发布以来，许多重要的进展已经发生——TensorFlow 2的发布、Transformer架构的日益流行等等。因此，2019年底，我开始更新我的书。我最初相当幼稚地认为，它将包含大约50%的新内容，并且最终长度大致与第一版相同。实际上，在两年的工作后，它的长度超过了三分之一，约有75%是全新内容。它不仅是一次更新，而且是一本全新的书。
- en: I wrote it with a focus on making the concepts behind deep learning, and their
    implementation, as approachable as possible. Doing so didn’t require me to dumb
    down anything—I strongly believe that there are no difficult ideas in deep learning.
    I hope you’ll find this book valuable and that it will enable you to begin building
    intelligent applications and solve the problems that matter to you.

  zh: 我写这本书的重点是尽可能使深度学习背后的概念以及它们的实现变得易于理解。这样做并不需要我简化任何内容——我坚信在深度学习中没有难懂的理念。我希望你会发现这本书有价值，并且它能让你开始构建智能应用程序并解决对你而言重要的问题。
