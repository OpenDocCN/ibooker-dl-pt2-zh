    information. Each expert specializes in a specific area, such as monitoring incoming
    network traffic for unusual activities, checking the security of customer accounts,
    overseeing employee access and permissions, including actions like copying or
    downloading sensitive data, and analyzing digital communications for any suspicious
    conversations or data transfers. While each expert has their unique tasks, they
    all share the common goal of safeguarding the financial institution. To achieve
    this, they collaborate by sharing insights and data. For example, if there’s unusual
    activity in a customer’s account, it triggers an alert that is immediately analyzed
    by the network traffic expert, who cross-references it with employee access logs.
    If something seems suspicious, the collaborative experts can take prompt action,
    such as blocking the activity or raising an alert. In this example, we described
    the Smart Agents approach, a powerful artificial intelligence technique based
    on using adaptive, autonomous, and goal-oriented entities to solve a problem.
    Smart agents are designed to interact with their environment and other agents
    in a goal-oriented manner, using their knowledge and abilities to achieve the
    best outcome. One of the greatest strengths of this technology is that smart agents
    are not merely programmed to follow rules; they adapt and continually learn from
    activities.

  zh: 想象一群安全专家共同保护敏感的金融信息。每位专家都专注于特定领域，比如监视传入网络流量是否存在异常活动，检查客户账户的安全性，监督员工的访问和权限，包括复制或下载敏感数据等操作，以及分析数字通信中是否存在可疑对话或数据传输。虽然每位专家都有自己独特的任务，但他们都共享一个共同的目标，那就是保护金融机构。为了实现这一目标，他们通过分享见解和数据进行合作。例如，如果客户账户中出现异常活动，就会触发警报，立即由网络流量专家进行分析，并与员工访问日志进行交叉参考。如果有什么可疑之处，协作的专家们可以迅速采取行动，比如阻止活动或发出警报。在这个例子中，我们描述了智能代理方法，这是一种基于使用自适应、自主和目标导向实体来解决问题的强大人工智能技术。智能代理被设计成以目标导向的方式与环境和其他代理进行交互，利用他们的知识和能力来实现最佳结果。这项技术的最大优势之一是，智能代理不仅仅是被编程来遵循规则；它们会适应并不断从活动中学习。

    of changes is found that leads from the initial state to the goal state. Potential
    solutions are generated and tested until the objective is attained or until no
    more possible solutions exist to evaluate. For problems that suffer from a combinatorial

- en: A similar but slightly different approach involves the definition of some sort
    of metric that expresses the distance between two states. From a given state,
    the system could evaluate all legal transitions and choose the one that results
    in a state that is closest to the goal state with respect to the metric that has
    been defined. Depending on the problem, this process could generate an optimal
    solution or a non-optimal solution, or it might fail to produce a solution at
    all if its reasoning only leads to dead ends. Still, other approaches might use
    rules and constraints, described in chapters 2 and 3, to systematically reduce
    the number of states that need to be explored.

    state transformations. When an allowable state is explored, it will be followed
    by the next level consisting of its children, then the next level of its grandchildren,
    and so on. In our example, from this initial state, there are several possible
    scenarios that the farmer could select to transition to the next state. The farmer
    could, for instance, choose to take himself and the cabbage first. This will result
    in a new state where the wolf and the goat are left alone as the farmer and cabbage
    are on the other side of the river. Based on the earlier constraints, the wolf
    will eat the goat; therefore, this state should be rejected. Other potential moves
    are “the farmer together with the wolf,” “the farmer with the goat,” and “the
    farmer alone.” When a new allowable state is selected, the same logic will be
    used to determine additional moves from this state. This process is repeated until
    “the farmer, goat, cabbage, and wolf are all on the right side of the river,”
    or no other allowable move to a new state is possible.

  zh: 解决方案最终将通过生成和测试允许的状态转换来实现。当探索到一个允许的状态时，它将被其子状态组成的下一级所跟随，然后是其孙状态的下一级，依此类推。在我们的例子中，从这个初始状态开始，农夫可以选择几种可能的情况来过渡到下一个状态。例如，农夫可以选择先带着自己和白菜过河。这将导致一个新的状态，狼和山羊将被留在一起，因为农夫和白菜在河的另一侧。根据先前的约束条件，狼会吃掉山羊；因此，这个状态应该被拒绝。其他潜在的移动是“农夫与狼一起”，“农夫与山羊一起”和“农夫单独”。当选择了一个新的允许状态时，相同的逻辑将被用来确定从这个状态开始的其他移动。这个过程重复进行，直到“农夫、山羊、白菜和狼都在河的右侧”，或者没有其他允许的移动到新状态的可能性。

    agents for the farmer, wolf, cabbage, and goat. In a smart agent program, every
    element of the problem is represented by an agent, and every agent has a goal.
    Each agent in our problem would also have a location attribute, and to begin,
    the locations would all be set to *east*. The goal of the farmer, cabbage, goat,
    and wolf would be to have the location *west*, and the farmer would have the additional
    goal of being in the same location as all three of his possessions. The logic
    of the program would have to address which goals are more important than others
    under certain circumstances.

  zh: 要解决智能代理技术中的这个问题，我们将首先为农夫、狼、白菜和山羊创建代理。在智能代理程序中，问题的每个元素都由一个代理表示，并且每个代理都有一个目标。在我们的问题中，每个代理也会有一个位置属性，并且开始时，所有代理的位置都将被设置为*east*。农夫、白菜、山羊和狼的目标是拥有*west*位置，而农夫还有一个额外的目标是与他的三个财产在同一个位置。程序的逻辑必须处理在某些情况下哪些目标比其他目标更重要的问题。
- en: Some agents in our problem would also have the keywords *stabilize* and *unstabilize.*
    Keeping in mind that keywords can represent a lot of complex logic, we have to
    understand the values taken by these keywordsin the context of the problem. For
    example, we know that it’s unacceptable for the farmer to leave the cabbage alone
    with the goat, so for the cabbage, the *unstabilize* keyword would be set to the
    condition that the location of the cabbage is the same as the location of the
    goat. *Stabilize* could be set to the condition that its location is the same
    as the location of the farmer. The logic in the program would then be able to
    dismiss options in which the cabbage is with the goat unless the farmer is also
    there.

  zh: 在我们的问题中，一些代理也会有关键字*stabilize*和*unstabilize*。牢记关键字可以代表很多复杂逻辑，我们必须理解这些关键字在问题背景下的取值。例如，我们知道农夫不能让白菜独自与山羊在一起，因此对于白菜来说，*unstabilize*关键字会被设置为白菜位置与山羊位置相同的条件。*Stabilize*可以被设置为其位置与农夫位置相同的条件。程序中的逻辑将能够排除白菜与山羊在一起但农夫不在的选项。

- en: 'Smart agents offer valuable problem-solving techniques. Consider our experience
    in developing a fraud prevention solution as an example. Personalization emerged
    as a pivotal concept in this endeavor. Using smart agents, we were able to create
    virtual personal profiles for cardholders, stores, and merchants, with only the
    relevant information for each entity. Each cardholder is associated with a smart
    agent that continuously learns from its transactions in real time. It aggregates
    data from various channels, tracking anything relevant to the cardholder, gradually
    forming a robust profile over time. In contrast to other AI methods discussed
    in chapters 2 and 3, smart agent systems make decisions tailored to each cardholder.
    Personalized decisions consistently outperform universally applied generic rules.
    A cardholder’s profile reflects their unique spending habits, and once a baseline
    pattern is established, any deviation from normal behavior is immediately detected.
    There are virtually no limits to the types or number of profiling criteria that
    smart agents can define for use. Examining an entity from multiple angles is essential
    since behavior can vary significantly depending on circumstances. Here are some
    profiling criteria commonly used in fraud detection:'

  zh: 智能代理提供了宝贵的问题解决技术。以我们在开发欺诈防范解决方案的经验为例。个性化成为此努力的一个关键概念。利用智能代理，我们能够为持卡人、商店和商家创建虚拟个人资料，只包含每个实体的相关信息。每个持卡人都与一个智能代理相关联，该代理实时从其交易中持续学习。它从各种渠道聚合数据，跟踪与持卡人有关的任何内容，随着时间的推移逐渐形成一个强大的资料。与第2章和第3章讨论的其他AI方法相比，智能代理系统做出了针对每个持卡人的决策。个性化的决策始终优于普遍适用的通用规则。持卡人的资料反映了他们独特的消费习惯，一旦建立了基线模式，任何与正常行为偏离的情况都会立即被检测到。对于智能代理可以为使用定义的各种类型或数量的分析标准几乎没有限制。从多个角度审视一个实体是至关重要的，因为行为可能根据情况而有很大的变化。以下是在欺诈检测中常用的一些分析标准：

    profiles, merchant profiles, and other relevant data to generate a risk score.
    Transactions are approved only if the score falls below a certain threshold. Innovative
    systems may adjust their scoring and thresholds based on circumstances, recognizing
    that a purchase unusual for an individual in July might be typical before Christmas,
    reducing false positives and improving the overall experience for everyone involved.
