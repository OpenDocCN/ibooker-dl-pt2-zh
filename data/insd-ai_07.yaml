    or advanced the algorithms, an AI program faces a substantial challenge in inferring
    intelligence from data due to the semantic gap, as AI algorithms can process data
    but struggle to grasp its deeper meanings. Even for simpler tasks, such as recognizing
    handwritten numbers, where AI models excel, they still lack the capability to
    grasp the context surrounding these numbers. For instance, an AI system might
    correctly identify a handwritten 9 as the numeric symbol 9, but it remains unable
    to infer that this number more likely represents a child’s age on a birthday card.

- en: The Farmer-Wolf-Goat-Cabbage riddle, previously discussed in chapter 4, serves
    as a prime example illustrating the constraints of AI when confronted with problems
    that demand logical reasoning and strategic planning. Traditional machine learning
    models primarily depend on statistical patterns and data-driven training, rendering
    them unsuitable for tasks that necessitate deductive reasoning, forward planning,
    and a deep comprehension of specific constraints, as exemplified by this simple
    problem. In this puzzle, the farmer must safely transport the wolf, goat, and
    cabbage across a river, ensuring that neither the wolf eats the goat nor the goat
    consumes the cabbage. While AI excels in domains such as natural language understanding,
    image recognition, and game playing, these domains typically involve activities
    based on pattern recognition and optimization, drawing from historical data. In
    contrast, solving the Farmer-Wolf-Goat-Cabbage riddle calls for symbolic reasoning
    or symbolic AI techniques, reliant on explicit rules and logic to determine the
    correct sequence of actions while adhering to predefined constraints. Real progress
    in AI will require the development of innovative techniques, such as smart agents,
    that extend beyond the confines of learning solely from data.

    that AI possesses the capability to acquire “intelligence” from data. However,
    AI systems trained on data are insufficient for conducting accurate medical diagnoses.
    One fundamental limitation is the absence of medical understanding. AI programs
    trained on data can identify statistical patterns and correlations, but they lack
    an inherent grasp of the underlying medical concepts, disease mechanisms, and
    the complexity of the human body. Medical diagnosis often demands an understanding

    and one king (figure 7.1). Each type of piece possesses its own distinctive movement
    rules. For example, a pawn typically moves one square forward at a time, except

    take turns, with white pieces making the first move. A piece captures an opponent’s

- en: The traditional method for programming turn-based games, as seen in the development
    of IBM’s Deep Blue for chess, involves storing the game tree in computer memory.
    In this approach, the system assesses the desirability of positions at the endpoints
    of branches, systematically adds more nodes to the tree for a deeper search, and
    prunes less promising branches. The computer then selects its move based on the
    positions with the highest evaluations. Competitive turn-based games often come
    with time limits. Each player is initially allocated a specific amount of time,
    which decreases when it’s their turn to make a move. If a player’s time runs out,
    they typically lose the game. Consequently, a computer must rely on heuristics
    to determine how much time to allocate for computations and when to make a move.
    Just like human players, it needs to strike a balance between spending time to
    find potentially better moves and conserving time for future turns, avoiding rapid
